<p><strong>Q: What do you think of the PlayStation2 hardware in general?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> The PS2 hardware is extremely exciting and even cool-looking. We always wish we had more VRAM and we always wish we had more processing power, but given the year we are living in and what else is available out there, this machine is truly amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What does the PlayStation2 allow you to do for your games that wasn't possible on previous consoles?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> We are now allowed more characters on screen, more elaborate behaviors that appear to emulate life, larger worlds that have more AI running underneath everythingâ€”in short, the PS2 allows us to completely rethink how a game should be built, how it should look, and also how it should be played.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you consider the biggest challenge of developing for PlayStation2?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> Unless you're building established genre games like sports, fighting or racing, then we think the biggest challenge is creative. Knowing what is should be, how it should play, and what makes it unlike anything that people have played before. 3D is a conquered mountain and 32bit proved that lots of people can pull off the technology of 3D relatively quickly. It's the great ideas that are the endangered species in this industry.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you think of the Dual Shock2?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> We think it's quite simply the best controller out there. They are doing this so right it's not even funny. Controller complexity is something that holds back a lot of creativty. However, with all buttons being analog you can combine many moves that would have needed unique button combinations into a single button. In the end, the easier the controls are, the more people will be able it and probably the more fun they will have. Also with the Dual Shock2, because it is packaged with the PS2, you can design things to demand the use of the dual shock analog sticks. This breaks open completely new control opportunities that you just wouldn't do before.</p>
