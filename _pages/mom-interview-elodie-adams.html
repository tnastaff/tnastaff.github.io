<p><strong>Magog on the March: We’ll start off with an easy one: What is your favourite game in the Oddworld franchise?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams:</strong> My fondest memories are of playing Oddysee. The environments were incredible back then and of course still are today even though we're talking 90s graphics :) I'm a very terrible gamer buy I absolutely love immersive fantasy environments and the gameplay was/is so fresh and original.</p>
<p><strong>Magog on the March: You once said in an interview that your were introduced to Lorne Lanning via a friend on Facebook. Could you please tell us more about your relationship with Lanning and the conversations that led to your involvement with “New ’n’ Tasty”, perhaps for the benefit of those who would like to work with Oddworld Inhabitants one day?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams:</strong> Ah. It was a very once in a lifetime sort of thing. Chance. Unfortunately the music industry is a cruel beast and I was just fortunate Lorne heard my voice. A friend told me Lorne had a Facebook account so I sent him a link to my YouTube demo and he actually listened to it. That never happens! He replied and told me he felt the lyrics were about Abe's journey and his relationship with the Mudokons, which I felt was such an honor. It's interesting as a songwriter, when you compose music with one intention and those listening hear something entirely else.</p>
<p><strong>Magog on the March: What's the story behind the song "Born to Love You"? Could you also give us your interpretation on how it relates to Abe, Oddworld and “New 'n' Tasty” itself?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams:</strong> Well I wrote the song about my relationship with the music industry. How it is sort of evil and tears you apart from the inside out without a care in the world but you keep going out of love for the music. I am sure Lorne can answer this question much better than I can. Actually he never discussed with me what his interpretation of the lyrics were... just that he had one :)</p>
<p><strong>Magog on the March: Some hardcore fans of the Oddworld franchise have voiced criticism at the inclusion of “Born to Love You” in “New ’n’ Tasty”, believing the atmospheric ode of that tied off the original game suited the atmosphere of the world better. What is your response to this?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams:</strong> Lorne created Oddworld and he loved the song that I wrote so his opinion is the only one I really pay any attention to. I have an incredible respect for Lorne. What the fans don't know is that we also went through... maybe 10-15 or so revisions of the song so the final product is the one that Lorne himself responded very positively to.</p>
<p><strong>Magog on the March: Did you get a chance to play “New ’n’ Tasty”? If so, what did you think of the final product?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams:</strong> Yes of course I did :) I had to hear my song in the credits. I felt the developers did a wonderful job!</p>
<p><strong>Magog on the March: What is it like to work with Lorne Lanning?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams:</strong> It was a life changing experience that I felt I was a bit too young for at the time. He really taught me what it's like to work on a large scale professional project and the importance of creating a sound that is appropriate for the overall vision. Before that I was making music on my laptop on my bedroom so I definitely wasn't prepared for anything of that scale! I definitely put my everything in to working as hard as I could and creating the best sound that I could. I grew up from being involved in New n Tasty.</p>
<p><strong>Magog on the March: Feel free to answer: Were you once an Oddworld "Fan of the Month"? http://oddworldlibrary.net/archives/web/oddworld.com/firsttenyears/alf/ow_fan07.shtml<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams:</strong> Yup that's me as a kid!! How embarrassing!!!</p>
<p><strong>Magog on the March: Will you be playing “Oddworld: Soulstorm”?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams: </strong>Absolutely :) How could anyone resist giving it a spin!!</p>
<p><strong>Magog on the March: What are you working on next in your professional life?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams:</strong> I've been dealing with some pretty serious health issues since then. I was diagnosed with fibro myalgia, which which doesn't have a cure and means I'm constantly in chronic pain and... well you know, life sometimes throws challenges at you that break you before making you stronger and I feel that I'm just coming out the other side. I wouldn't recommend getting an incurable illness.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Regardless of that, music will always be a part of my life whether I like it or not since it sort of follows me around like a stalker. I can't stop melodies and lyrics from talking to me. It's always been that way.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Honestly... I have no definitive plans for my life right now so we'll see what happens. Life is funny like that :)</p>
