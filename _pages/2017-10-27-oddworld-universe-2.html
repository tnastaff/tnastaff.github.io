<p>The Oddworld Universe was a section on the old Oddworld Inhabitants website that hosted a wealth of detailed lore and tidbits concerning Oddworld's varied inhabitants, facilities and environments. This resource was not only an elaborate reservoir during Oddworld's more reserved periods, but it also inspired an entire generation of discourse. Due to the popularity of the Oddworld Universe, we have attempted to preserve as much of the experience as sligly possible.</p>
