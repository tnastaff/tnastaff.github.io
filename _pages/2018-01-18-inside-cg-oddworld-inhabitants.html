<blockquote><p>Many hours of planning and hard work are put into even the most insignificant characters like the rat. From production design to modeling and animation, the attention to detail is what makes our characters unique.Even though the Rat was cut from gameplay, it does appear in the CG movies. Production Designer, Farzad Varahramyan and CG Technical Director, Matt Aldridge explain what's involved.</p></blockquote>
