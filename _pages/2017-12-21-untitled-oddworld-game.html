<pre>Untitled Oddworld Game

Developer: Dprock PlaysOld
Date Announced: 12 November 2017
Release Date: TBA

Genre: Platform
Engine: Unity</pre>
<p>This rather interesting project by YouTuber Dprock PlaysOld, or Daniel—which is currently untitled—is a relatively new project evidentially inspired by <em>Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee</em>. In the brief footage that Daniel has shown, we have seen a re-created Spooceshrub Forest in the Unity Engine, a versatile Abe traversing the lush lands, as well as a working Slig AI.</p>

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>Although little is known about this game, Daniel has revealed that while there is indeed a backstory, this is not a continuation to <em>Munch's Oddysee</em>, suggesting the game will tell an alternate story instead.</p>
