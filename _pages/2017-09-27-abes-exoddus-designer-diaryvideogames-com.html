<p>By Paul O’Connor, Lead Game Designer</p>
<p>It’s an Odd, Oddworld, once again. Abe, the absinthe‐skinned Mudokon and star of GT Interactive’s <em><span class="title">Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee</span></em> title, will soon be embarking on his second journey, picking up precisely where his last mission left off. This game, <em><span class="title">Abe’s Exoddus</span></em>, is more of an offshoot of the first title, while <em><span class="title">Munch’s Oddysee</span></em>, the next game set for release, will actually continue the ‘Quintology’ the developers have planned for the series.</p>
<p>The story begins at the point where, by destroying the factory and all the Mudokon bones stashed inside (during the end of the first game), Abe has given the Glukkons reason to need another cache of bones so they can continue making their carnivorous beverages. In <em><span class="title">Exoddus</span></em>, you will again venture into the mission as Abe, only this time, with more feeling. Not only will <em><span class="title">Exoddus</span></em> include more Gamespeak, you will also reportedly discover more intelligent AI, and fellow Mudokons will wear their emotions on their skin, literally, as blue will depict melancholy, red will display anger, and so on. As Abe, you will have to interact with the Mudokons, by hugging and so forth, to keep them from committing suicide and even taking advantage of your kindness. Zombified Mudokons, notably Mudombies, will need Abe’s assistance in finding their way to safety as well.</p>
<p>Many of the former enemies, such as Scrabs and Sligs, will return. However, Fleeches, Slurgs, Necrum Spirits, and Slogs will also attempt to keep you and your kind from safety. And while saving the Mudokons is foremost, there will be lots of chores for Abe along the way, so to speak. <em><span class="title">Abe’s Exoddus</span></em> is expected for the PlayStation in the fourth quarter of ’98. Until then, the developers at Oddworld Inhabitants will be contributing diaries to videogames.com every two weeks to keep our readers up on its progress. Enjoy.</p>
