<p>Dear Mr Kojima,</p>
<p>We read with great excitement on VG247 that you were looking for a studio to work with to develop a Metal Gear Solid remake using the Fox Engine, that your team has been hard at work creating.</p>
<p>We at Just Add Water feel ideally positioned to do the remake justice for several reasons:<br />
1.We have experience working with legendary IP (Oddworld Inhabitants) and treating the subject matter with the respect it deserves.<br />
2.Many members of our team are huge Metal Gear fans, with very good knowledge of the source material.<br />
3.We really, really want to do it.</p>
<p>For evidence of our abilities, please check out not only the HD treatment of Oddworld: Stranger’s Wrath, released on PlayStation3, VITA and PC, but the current re-creation of Abe’s Oddysee, titled Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty.</p>
<p>We eagerly await your response.</p>
<p>Love and cuddles,<br />
The JAW Team.</p>
