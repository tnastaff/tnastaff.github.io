<h3><strong>43 ODDWORLD STRANGER'S WRATH</strong></h3>
<p>A FARTY, GASSY ADDITION TO THE ACTION GENRE</p>
<h5>SYS: XB PUB: ELECTRONIC ARTS DEV: ODDWORLD INHABITANTS REL DATE: JANUARY</h5>
<p>Originally an Xbox game developed for Microsoft, <em>Stranger's Wrath</em> got dropped, picked up by EA, attached to a PS2 version, separated from the cancelled PS2 version, and moved up to an early 2005 release. Players control Stranger, a rough, humanlike animal cowboy that can roam in third person or shoot animals with his crossbow in first person. "In first person, I can only move up to a maximum of about 15 miles per hour, and that's really like <em>Halo</em> speed relative to the scale of the world," says Lorne Lanning, cofounder of developer Oddworld Inhabitants. "In third person, I can get up to 55 miles an hour, but I can't shoot."</p>
<p><strong>MONSTER MAGNET:</strong> The story "has some major plot twists that occur as you're playing," says Lanning.</p>
