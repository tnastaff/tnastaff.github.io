<p>Hey gang,</p>
<p>Between the previous Dev Diary and the next I wanted just to show you an update to the PS3 Stranger model. The work is almost done on the model of the main character, so whilst we work away on the game I wanted to give you this short update, and let you guys get a look at <em>Stranger</em>.</p>
<p>We hope you like him.</p>
