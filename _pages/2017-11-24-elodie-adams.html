<p>When you hear the words “neo-gothic rock queen” strung together, it gets you curious enough to track down the person in question. The person we found was Elodie Adams. Hopefully reading those words has you curious enough to spend a little time with her also. You won’t regret it.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda: Hi Elodie, thanks for taking the time to chat with Forte. How are you and what are you up to at the moment?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams:</strong> Hey Amanda! I just arrived home from the gym. It’s 9.p.m. and I’m listening to Muse, drinking English Breakfast Tea and mentally preparing myself to answer these questions…</p>
<p><strong>Amanda: How are you feeling having your debut release inSUBORDINATE out and available for the world to hear?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams:</strong> I feel relieved, actually! There was a period of time, around the middle of production, where I thought I wouldn’t be able to emotionally cross that line and say, ‘That’s it, we’ve finished’. I kept on wanting to make changes. The process had been going on for so many months I had lost perspective and couldn’t hear what I hear now so clearly. If it wasn’t for my producer who listened to me, encouraged me and enabled me to pull myself together, I don’t know if the EP would be on iTunes right now.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda: You’ve already got one of the tracks on a new best-selling PlayStation game Oddworld: New ’n’ Tasty. Is that a pretty surreal thing?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams:</strong> It is such a surreal thing, I don’t know if it has really hit me properly yet. The day the game was released back in July, I woke up, turned on my phone and it wouldn’t stop buzzing for about 20 minutes due to all the notifications from Oddworld fans on social media. It was a very, very strange feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda: Are you much of a gamer?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams:</strong> To be honest, my life has become so much of a frenzied blur over the past few years, these days I really only have time to work and sleep. All other aspects of my life have to be put on hold to make room for how busy I am becoming with my music career.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">However, I am definitely a nerd. I love anime, manga and video games. I love going to arcades. I love to cosplay. I love attending conventions. Some of the fondest memories from my childhood are from attending cons … Actually, my first professional gig was at a pop culture con.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda: In ‘Born to Love You’ the song explores the idea of having two sides – the real you and the fantasy you. Is this something you’ve experienced now you’re in the public eye?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams: </strong>Yes, it has become much more difficult to separate the two now. In saying that, I think every great artist has an internal muse they use to creatively express themselves, but I also think that prohibits them from really investing in others, so as to avoid breaking the illusion.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda: You’ve grown up playing classical music from an early age. What is it you love about it?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams:</strong> Everything! I connect to classical music in a way I can’t connect to anything else. When I hear classical music I feel vulnerable, fragile … able to give love, able to accept to love. I feel compassionate. Empathetic … I yearn to experience the entire range of my emotional capacity as a human being. Classical music makes the world shine with beauty through the lens of rose-coloured glasses.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda: What does music mean to you?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams:</strong> Without music, my life would be inconsequential.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda: Thanks again for chatting with us. Is there anything you’d like to add before we finish up?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Elodie Adams:</strong> Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one’s mistakes – Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray.</p>
<p><strong>Release: inSUBORDINATE out now</strong></p>
