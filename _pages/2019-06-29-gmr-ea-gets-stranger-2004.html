<p>Developer Oddworld Inhabitants, best known for <em>Munch's Oddysee</em> at the Xbox launch, has announced a new publisher for its latest game. Electronic Arts will publish <em>Stranger</em>, assumed to be a casualty of the game bloodbath that followed Ed Fries' departure from MS early this year. It will appear on Xbox and PS2 in 2005.</p>
