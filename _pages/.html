<p>Oddworld: Story Stones IV - GLOKTIGI</p>
<p>While the average inhabitant might believe that Industrialists have denounced<br />
their spirituality and dedicated the entirety of their existence to science and<br />
technology, this is actually far from the truth. Behind closed doors, the<br />
wealthiest and most powerful members of the Industrialist clans dabble in<br />
alchemy and the dark art of the occult. These lend them supernatural powers and<br />
even mastery over life as evidenced by Gloktigi, bizarre hybrids birthed by<br />
Glukkon queens and fathered by high ranking Oktigi, held together by alchemy and<br />
genetics.[1]</p>
<p>The Gloktigi embody Oddworld's version of Djinns, evil spirits bound by<br />
contracts to do their master's bidding. Standing over fifteen feet tall, they<br />
reach the height of the fearsome Vykker security robots, the Snoozers.[2]</p>
<p>By tapping into their occult powers[3], they have the ability to spontaneously<br />
become translucent and non-corporeal, which lets them ignore gravity and freely<br />
pass through solid objects. Also they are able to eject a green, sticky<br />
substance, that wraps around their victim, incapatitaing them. Anyone<br />
unfortunate enough to be caught in it is then promptly dispatched either by the<br />
creature's shots or it's razor sharp talons.</p>
<p>These particular skills coupled with their extreme durability make them<br />
excellent bodyguards for Industrialist VIPs, who are frequently seen with one<br />
or two of Gloktigi at their side.</p>
<p>Stranger meets four of these beings who have been cybernetically enchanced,<br />
while invading Sekto Springs. [4] The creatures, whom Sekto refers to as his<br />
pets never seem to utter a word, their vocalization consisting only of pig-like<br />
squeals. One might believe that they are animals guided solely by their<br />
instincts, however, in reality Gloktigi are intelligent and cunning, but also<br />
terribly egoistical. For them any other creature is so inferior, that they<br />
won't even tire themselves with trying to speak to them. They also tend to<br />
undergo fits of violence, where they can't contain their demonic frenzy.<br />
Despite this, they are still highly-trained and loyal to their masters. [5]</p>
<p>However, a beast of such immense power faces a relatively short life. Their<br />
average lifespan of 40 years [6] means they live about as long as a Mudokon<br />
drone does [7].<br />
