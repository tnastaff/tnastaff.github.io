<p>A highly-social race of gentle, amphibious creatures, Gabbits are much prized by Vykkers for the medicinal value of their lungs, and for their eggs—called Gabbiar—which Glukkons consider a delicacy. Great schools of Gabbits once swam the seas of Oddworld, calling to each other in their cheerful, musical speech. Baby Gabbits who, like tadpoles, gradually gain new capabilities as they grow until they become full-fledged Gabbits. Munch is currently the last of the Gabbit species, Gabbiwogs are no more than a historical curiosity. But they sure are cute!</p>
