<p>Robbed of their proud and ancient legacy by profit-crazy Glukkons, the Mudokons are the slave labor force of RuptureFarms and SoulStorm Brewery. Because there are no animals left to slaughter, these chumps are the flavor or the week. Worker Mudokons are divided into the Employed Worker Class or Freed Worker Class. The Employed Worker Class or Scrub Mudokons are the lowest of the low. These pathetic Mudokons have been forced into slave labor for the Industrialists cleaning Slog poo and making those Vendo machines sparkle.</p>
