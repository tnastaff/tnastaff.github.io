<p><strong>Oddysee to return in 3D</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>PlayStation 2 version of Oddysee promises significant revamp.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Munch's Oddysee</em> is the third instalment in the <em>Oddworld</em> quintet of games. It follows on from <em>Abe's Oddysee</em> but shuns the 2D puzzle-based platform style for an altogether different approach.</p>
<p><em>Munch's Oddysee</em> will be in real-time 3D and will focus on the world of Oddworld itself, the relationship between the inhabitants and the story of Munch. All of the game's characters will have individual life-cycle patterns. An ambitious project, but the sort that's likely to become more common with the advent of PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>Who is Munch? Well, Munch, like Abe, is an accidental hero. He's "at the bottom of the food chain and slipping fast". As the last of species, the Gabbits, his lungs are in huge demand. Gabbits, you see, make ideal donors for Glukkons when they get lung cancer. A lot of Glukkons get cancer.</p>
<p><em>Munch's Oddysee</em> also sees the welcome return for the loveable Abe. His fate is intertwined with Munch's and you get to control both characters. You also have control over the inhabitants of Oddworld in a similar way to the original game. Here, though, you will be able to command entire armies to do your bidding.</p>
<p>Think of <em>Munch's Oddysee</em> as less a game and more of a place. It sounds absolutely fascinating.</p>
