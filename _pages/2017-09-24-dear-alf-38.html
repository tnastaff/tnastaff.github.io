<p>You ask for it, Alf sort of sends this thing that vaguely resembles a reply and almost never directly relates to an answer ... But that's why we love him. Take a gamble and send your questions to the old Alfster... you might get a reply! Just remember that the odds are always with the house, or in this case, the rehab!</p>
<p>They say the only dumb question is the one that doesn't get asked. Well, I beg to differ. The dumb question is the one that gets asked OVER AND OVER AGAIN! So, before you write, check our list of <a href="http://oddworldlibrary.net/archives/web/oddworld.com/alf/ow_ask.shtml">Most Frequently Asked Questions!</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q: Hey alf. Umm.Uhhh.R u abez brother or something? O an y r u mudz skiny? Glukkonmaster. Sorry 4 bad spelling,im jst tird.</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf: </strong> Hello there. I am Abe's brother in the sense that all Mudokons are brothers, but we aren't directly related, if that's what you mean. Are we skiny? Is this a combo of skinny and shiny? Because the answer is nyos!</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q: Hi Alf, Its Odd-Joe. I have just a few questions after saying that I love Oddworld and this site, so here they are:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>1. In the game "Oddworld Stranger's Wrath" will there be any connections to the other games such as mudokins or glukkons appearing that show it is indeed oddworld that Stranger lives in?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>2. Why are Abe's lips sown together?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>3. I know this is a frequent question, but will there really be a movie or are you just yanking our chain?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>4. Will there ever be a game where you can play multiplayer/co-operative?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Well I hope you reply. Thanx </strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf: </strong> Well, first of all there will be plenty of connections to the old games in Oddworld Stranger's Wrath. You are definitely going to know that this is an Oddworld game. Just because Abe and Munch are MIA doesn't mean we aren't us. Trust me, that makes sense if you think about it! What could be more odd than the stranger I ask you???? Not much. There will be fuzzles, a Vykker, and all of the wonderful ways to smash, bash, slice and dice those arrogant enough to defy the forces of Odd. Yer gonna love it! And Joe, really, you should know by now why Abe's lips are sewn shut- cuz he asked me too many questions! Har! Just kidding. As for movies and Co-Op play, all I can say is the future is both unknown and inevitable.</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q:  Why a western? What is up with that? I'm not really into that hokey cowboy stuff.</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf: </strong>"Western" is only one of the influences for OSW. Soon you will see more and more of the regions and levels, where much a much different landscape is revealed. The journey of the stranger takes him to all different climates and terrain. Snowcapped mountains, lush forests, riverside junkyards to name a few. He also encounters all sorts of folks along the way, with their own, how shall we say, "quirks."</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q:   Can you tell me the different ammo types and what they do? </strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf: </strong> There are too many to list here! But you can check out their feature at <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/adventure/oddworldtentativetitle/preview_6114394.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamespot.</a>  Gamespot also has tons of info, screenshots and video downloads for your viewing pleasure. Check it all out and be the most knowledgeable kind on the block about an obscure quasi-western video game with a bounty hunter in it. I'm sure in some places this is the definition of popularity.</p>
<p><strong>Q:  What are some of the new species we are going to encounter in Oddworld Stranger's Wrath? </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf: </strong> Wow, there are a slew of 'em. There are the Wolvarks, the Outlaws, the Outlaw Minions, the Clakkerz, the Grubbs, Gloktigi and of course all of the live ammos. Wolvarks are kinda like security guards, but they are totally flaky and would rather nap than work. Of course they are meaner than all get out and you should avoid them at all costs. And did I mention that they're ugly? Cuz they are. Outlaws are, well, just kind of what they sound like. They live outside the law and make the strangers life so difficult, and yet provide him with a career. I guess it's that whole balance of nature thing.</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q:  How come no one ever writes to you asking about the new game anymore? Are they tired of your meaningless spiels, your bottomless pit answers? You're utter lack of decency? Have they completely given up on you? Do they not realize the veritable slogs trough of information that you have the potential to be? Shame on them. Shame.</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:  </strong>Gosh, I just don't know. With the game coming out next month you'd think people would be dying to know. Seems like the only mail I get these days is those friendly offers to enhance my Mudokon-hood or get a lower interest rate on my rehab payments. Kind offers, really, but not very useful when all I want to do is blabber on about the game!</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q:   Dear Alf i have got a question for you. What's with this pre-order DVD of Oddworld movies?</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong>  Hi there. I'm glad you asked! If you pre-order Oddworld Stranger's Wrath "only the Xbox", you'll receive and "bonus" DVD right then, well starting Jan.1st. This dvd contains all the cg/fmv movies from past games and OSW too. Yes, there is an "extras" section. The bonus DVD will also be available in Europe. Check out your eagames.com website for more info.</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q:   Any chance of getting more info and pictures about the new GAME? thanx - Bounty guy. </strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong>  Yes! Yes! Check out websites like Gamespot, IGN, Gamespy, EAgames and all the game magazines too. Look for features right now!</p>
