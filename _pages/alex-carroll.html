<p>-soulstorm-</p>
<p>OWI_Alex - 05/03/2017<br />
i'll re-iterate what we've said before. Oddworld now operates in a very distributed way, with an obvious central production system. We work with people we can be sure are doing great work, in the areas that they specialise in. Some key figures in New ‘n’ Tasty’s development are now working on art and level design, as you know. We’re also working with independent designers, artists and developers around the world that are doing some really exciting work for us that we can’t wait to share. We're yet to announce who those people and studios are, but we will, when the time comes to reveal.</p>
<p>-general oddworld-</p>
<p>OWI_Alex - 05/05/2017<br />
i think so, @Nemin. as we've said, Soulstorm is a sequel to New 'n' Tasty - but it's a new game. there's not really a way to not separate it, in that instance.<br />
Kev - 05/05/2017<br />
It's better that way.<br />
Nemin - 05/05/2017<br />
So it's a sequel. That cleared it for me<br />
I thought it's coming out of blue :smile:<br />
Kev - 05/05/2017<br />
Consider it like two timelines, Nemin.<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/05/2017<br />
right.<br />
Kev - 05/05/2017<br />
AO - AE - MO<br />
NNT - Soulstorm - ???<br />
Stranger kind of fits in both.<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/05/2017<br />
indeed.</p>
<p>OWI_Alex - 05/05/2017<br />
it's either we do things like this discord, where at least you know we're listening, and the ARG, or we go completely silent in between press releases. I know which i'd prefer.</p>
<p>HolySock - 05/05/2017<br />
Here's a question, Alex. The % of people on these things pales to the number of fans who enjoy Oddworld games. How does OWI decide when comments and criticism are worth listening to or just the ramblings of a small minority?</p>
<p>OWI_Alex - 05/05/2017<br />
@HolySock good question. i think when it's painfully obvious we got something not quite right, the voices are numerous, and we can fix those things in patches and so on. when it's complaints about things like, oh, er, the shade of green, well, i personally don't really soak that kind of feedback up. i think that's diplomatic enough, right? but i promise we do listen, and read, everything. sometimes it's really, really tough to read, but sometimes it's useful.</p>
<p>Nemin - 05/05/2017<br />
Just don't pack the game full with bloom-lightning :smile:(edited)<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/05/2017<br />
the bloom is an interesting one. we added the ability to take it off on PC, but it wasn't something we gave a toggle for on console. it's not really something that's easily dissected, but let's just say that whilst some didn't like the lighting in places, some did. personally, and this is just my opinion, a lot of folk that didn't agree with the brighter look to RuptureFarms didn't play much further - as some of the areas, like Paramonia, are beautiful, and really work well with the same lighting engine.</p>
<p>OWI_Alex - 05/05/2017<br />
so, yes, RF is lighter. but it's also a much clearer read, it's much more obvious where to go, and is closer to what the original intention was.</p>
<p>OWI_Alex - 05/05/2017<br />
you also have to consider that many people didn't complete AO. many people didn't ever get out of the first few rooms of RF. it's my opinion that the signposting helped (along with the difficulty levels, lighting, quiksave etc). obviously we have the stats to show that percentage wise people progressed further in NnT.(edited)</p>
<p>OWI_Alex - 05/05/2017<br />
there were so many things that got tweaked in RF for NnT quite close to launch for readability and flow. one day we'll document it all, it's an interesting story i'm sure. lots of areas tweaked to 'teach' the player the moves (such as the forced long jump midway through path 2) and things added to try to push people down a certain route.</p>
<p>OWI_Alex - 05/05/2017<br />
i think there was a small subset that wanted AO again, but the scale and scope changed considerably during development.</p>
<p>-Soulstorm-</p>
<p>OWI_Alex - 05/10/2017<br />
It's basically like Lorne said way back last year. Our plan is to keep up a progressive ARG (which you may or not be interested in, which is entirely up to you) which, via the community working together, will unlock art and screens, and more. Either we do that, or we close up and only reveal during major reveals.</p>
<p>As for the plushies - we polled the audience, and the audience really wanted them. </p>
<p>Making a game takes a long time. Our reveal plan isn't public, obviously, but rest assured we have a structure in place to talk about Soulstorm, and show Soulstorm, as and when. </p>
<p>Oddworld isn't just about Soulstorm. At all. Sure, it's what the majority of our attention is on, because it's the first new game of ours since 2005, but there are always other projects bubbling, as you may have heard mention recently, along with our long term goals to continue to sell our legacy titles, merchandise, and so on.</p>
<p>The ARG will continue. Not every clue was found, but we are very much still working on it. The ARG helps to fill in the story of Soulstorm, and will tie into the game upon release. It's really, really not just about the image reveals - look deeper.</p>
<p>Orgasmusstoerung - 05/10/2017<br />
@OWI_Alex is a new Artbook planned?<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/10/2017<br />
@Orgasmusstoerung we are always looking at ways to show off Oddworld's art - whether or not we can find a suitable angle that brings a lot of new material to the table remains to be seen.</p>
<p>OWI_Alex - 05/10/2017<br />
I also want to address a few comments I've seen (albeit not on this discord) regarding the plushies Kickstarter. It shouldn't really take me to say this, but rest assured that the Kickstarter (which is run entirely by ESCToy, not us) is not paying for Soulstorm (I actually giggled when I read that last night) and any work that has gone into the Kickstarter hasn't altered the development trajectory of Soulstorm one iota. Different. Things.</p>
<p>People told us they wanted plushies. This is our step down that route and one we're really excited about. Kickstarter offers everyone the chance to voice their opinion and so ultimately the end product is what people really want from the brand. But yeah, as far as I know, that $40k is going entirely on manufacturing and such.</p>
<p>-chat-</p>
<p>OWI_Alex - 05/19/2017<br />
This is a Kickstarter by ESC Toys, not Oddworld. The guys at ESC are licensing, it's their project, so the financial perspective of NnT is irrelevant. </p>
<p>-soulstorm-</p>
<p>OWI_Alex - 05/20/2017<br />
it's more about making sure there's a balance between time and content. as we've said before, the ARG will ebb and flow as we approach specific dates. whilst we appreciate the hunger for more Soulstorm content, there's always the issue of timing to consider. that said, i'm pretty sure not everything has been discovered yet that's out there.<br />
Kev - 05/20/2017<br />
Anything you can say about E3, Alex?<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/20/2017<br />
no.<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/20/2017<br />
we don't talk about future dates/events/titles/releases/merch.</p>
<p>Kev - 05/20/2017<br />
The manual for Abe's Oddysee, while completely outdated now, gave us a glimpse of what was to come, and it fuelled our imaginations for two decades. There's nothing wrong with tidbits, or giving us an idea of what to expect in the future. It just seems that you guys are a bit bitter because so much has fallen by the wayside over the years, so it's better to say nothing at all.</p>
<p>OWI_Alex - 05/20/2017<br />
no bitterness here. simple: if we announce something before it's 100% ready, and it doesn't work out, there's disappointment. if we never announced the thing-that-didn't-make-it, nobody's any wiser, so nothing lost.<br />
Kev - 05/20/2017<br />
As I said, I don't agree with the ideology, but I understand why you're doing it. That disappointment is indicative of the investment this fandom has with the series. We're starved for detail though.<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/20/2017<br />
yes, i know, and it's appreciated. that's partly why we're doing the ARG alongside the development of the game, to keep a trickle of information/detail/screens whilst the dev continues.<br />
Kev - 05/20/2017<br />
Would you consider doing something like Paul O'Connor's development diaries again?<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/20/2017<br />
all i can say is that once we do start talking about soulstorm, there'll be a much more constant flow of information on the game.<br />
Kev - 05/20/2017<br />
That sounds promising!<br />
One more question: What was in those Soulstorm Brew USBs?(edited)<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/20/2017<br />
on the actual stick? the data? nothing.<br />
that said, we have more...<br />
TheMudokonGiant - 05/20/2017<br />
Oh no, Mudokon Pornography.</p>
<p>Nemin - 05/20/2017<br />
There is an SSB USB<br />
Kev - 05/20/2017<br />
There was a rumour that there was some content on there.  I guess that was false.<br />
Nemin - 05/20/2017<br />
damn<br />
Kev - 05/20/2017<br />
You should totally offer those for sale.<br />
Nemin - 05/20/2017<br />
That would actually be something I'd buy(edited)<br />
Kev - 05/20/2017<br />
https://twitter.com/oddworldinc/status/743554565660807168<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/20/2017<br />
somebody got one with some content on, i think.<br />
Kev - 05/20/2017</p>
<p>Nemin - 05/20/2017<br />
Daaamn<br />
That looks amazing<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/20/2017<br />
i have two right here, i kept a couple. they're really squishy.</p>
<p>-chat-</p>
<p>Vanilla ✜ ☕ - 05/25/2017<br />
was the only one they had at the stand though so I couldn't get the others<br />
@OWI_Alex  how does designing merch work for you guys, do you design it and gametee print or do gametee make it and you approve?<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/25/2017<br />
in terms of gametee - i don't think i'm speaking out of turn when i say that they design everything, and we approve/tweak a little as needed, before sign off from HQ. they have some incredibly talented artists and the whole team is a joy to work with.<br />
that's not the case for everything, but is it for gametee. with Limited Run, for example, we do all the artwork.<br />
Vanilla ✜ ☕ - 05/25/2017<br />
That's pretty cool actually, so the art work on Gametee is essentially professional fan art with an Official seal of approval<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/25/2017<br />
i think it's a little more than that, but in principle, i guess. gametee and us plan pretty far ahead and their quality is always top notch.</p>
<p>OWI_Alex - 05/30/2017<br />
about what?<br />
Vanilla ✜ ☕ - 05/30/2017<br />
the pc verions of AO and AE, certain tracks pitches seen to have been changed<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/30/2017<br />
i don't, sorry.<br />
Vanilla ✜ ☕ - 05/30/2017<br />
damn, might try the contact us page on the site cause I'm really curious<br />
cheers :smile:<br />
Xavier - 05/30/2017<br />
I doubt any of the people that made that decision are still around...<br />
Vanilla ✜ ☕ - 05/30/2017<br />
maybe I'll ask Alf :stuck_out_tongue:<br />
still waiting for a new Dear Alf, the OWI twitter said they'd use my photo of the tea recipe they made :smiley:<br />
TheMudokonGiant - 05/30/2017<br />
It's been a while since Dear Alf read his fan mail.<br />
:afanart~1:<br />
Guineapiglet - 05/30/2017<br />
That sucks @SteveBlockhead. I wonder if Bernice knows who to ask. If you get that done I'd love to see the results though<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/30/2017<br />
we are unlikely to offer support on how to mod out the game's audio, guys.<br />
Vanilla ✜ ☕ - 05/30/2017<br />
aww<br />
how come?<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/30/2017<br />
1 - the game doesn't support modding<br />
2 - officially, we don't either<br />
3 - the audio was build using wwise<br />
4 - we really don't have the time(edited)<br />
Vanilla ✜ ☕ - 05/30/2017<br />
When you say "don't support modding" do you mean literally, or is there something you have to do with the game to make it possible?<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/30/2017<br />
there's no modding functionality built in. you'd need to hack away at the asset files, which for obvious reasons we don't support.<br />
Vanilla ✜ ☕ - 05/30/2017<br />
But surly being able to mod a game increases the amount people play it and stuff, like Skyrim?<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/30/2017<br />
i'm not sure what you're asking. we can't retrospectively go back to NnT and build in modding support.<br />
Vanilla ✜ ☕ - 05/30/2017<br />
I guess with games like Oddworld the development team are thinking more about actually making the game rather than making the game moddable<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/30/2017<br />
making a game moddable ideally means it's a decision made from the outset, so that proper hooks and calls are available to tweak and bend the game once it's released. that isn't the case with NnT, so any mods are really wrappers or hacks. some of them are great (like the one for 3DTVs) but with things like audio, it's simply not something we can realistically offer support for.</p>

<p>TheMudokonGiant - 05/31/2017<br />
I tried to play Munch's Oddysee<br />
on Steam once<br />
but the port was so bad<br />
the game was laggy<br />
RSRay - 05/31/2017<br />
for those who are wondering i am talking about this http://steamcommunity.com/app/15740/discussions/0/412447613572972443/<br />
OWI_Alex - 05/31/2017<br />
We made massive improvements to Munch. It was basically a new port, from scratch, and now runs much better, at a higher frame rate, and more reliably. Is there something specific you requested?</p>
