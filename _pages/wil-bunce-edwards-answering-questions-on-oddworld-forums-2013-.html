<p>Q: Are there any plans for a collector's edition/ hard copy of NnT? I'd love to get a blown up map of Oddworld and some cards or something.</p>
<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: We've certainly put thought into it, but at the end of the day it's a very expensive operation that we don't have the backing for. If we had a physical distributor with the existing infrastructure, that at least would be something. We'd still like to see it, so maybe we'll come up with something.</p>

<p>Q: Isn't there an option to start a kickstarter campaign for it or something? I would love some limited edition Oddworld stuff as well.</p>
<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: Crowdfunding is another thing we've spent a lot of time investigating. The conclusion we've drawn is that we don't want to expend the attention it would take to maintain a campaign on something relatively insignificant. And of course we'd all love merch, but it's not what's going to carry the biggest crowdfunding appeal.</p>
<p>Q: Do you mean the manufacturing infrastructure or the distribution infrastructure? If the latter, maybe take a look at what Telltale do: they sell digital copies through a whole bunch of services, plus both digital and physical copies (and merch) through their website.</p>
<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: That's the goal, not the solution. We need the storage, the handling, the packaging and shipping, and all of that is ridiculously expensive. We don't have the space or the time to do it ourselves.</p>

<p>Q: This is interesting. If the muds don't know any better and think they have a decent life, why oh why would they choose to follow Abe and jump trough his bird portal? Even more so after the events at Rupture Farms and the Magog propaganda about Abe being a terrorist. If the muds really think they are doing a good job you'd think they would actually try to stop him from getting to his goals.</p>
<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: Mudokons are na√Øve and trusting enough that they'll follow the instructions of someone coming up to them with a smile and a kind tone of voice. They also know in a non-conscious way that there's something wrong with being in RuptureFarms. And maybe there's something utterly irresistible about Bird Portals that makes Mudokons want to hurl themselves through them.</p>
<p>But we did have some fun thinking about exactly that question. We thought about having the Mudokons obey Abe out of fear ("Better do what he says!"), or even changing the gameplay so that you have to chase them into the portals. But at the end of the day, we're remaking an existing game with limited time and financial freedom to deviate much from the original, so there's none of that in the final scripts.</p>
<p>It's interesting that some story treatments for Abe have RuptureFarms warning Mudokons to ignore and report him because he's carrying a dangerous disease.</p>
<p>Q: Aren't Meetles the large transport ships Lulu uses to get to Vykers Labs?</p>
<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: There are multiple forms of Meetles, depending on (if you're Native) what you feed them or (if you're Civilized) how you cut them up. As best I can tell, the blimps evolved out of the idea of stitching and sewing Meetle bits into dirigibles. And hey, maybe that's what the fabrics are actually made of.</p>
<p>Q: Hey does anyone think the meeches was a scraped idea or was it just for show in AO</p>
<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: Definitely. There were originally going to be four temples, including the Meech temple.</p>
<p>Q: Or for that matter, why it is monsaic "lines". The only line in sight is the two-dimensional surface upon which you walk upon in the game.</p>
<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: Monsaic Lines is an ancient observatory. It's used for measuring the angles and harmonies of celestial bodies. Specifically the name 'Lines' might be taken from the Nazca Lines.</p>
<p>Q: Other than the brief description given in 'The Art of Oddworld Inhabitants', is there any other information on Ma'Spa?</p>
<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: Fun fact: Sekto Springs was originally going to have been built on top of Ma'Spa, just as its conceptual predecessor, a Vykkers dam, would have been in Munch's Exoddus.</p>

<p>Q: When you say blimp/dirigble, do you mean the Vykkers blimp, or the native blimps in this video? Surely the natives wouldn't do anything cruel to the Meetles?</p>
<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: I mean, the Civilized forces would have cut them apart and used their pieces to build flying vessels. The Mudokons turned Meetle grubs into those flying balloons by feeding them beans. The whole concept was later consolidated into feeding the creatures, so the industrialists would have gotten their balloons by feeding them chilli.</p>
<p>Q: Has that now been retconned out?</p>
<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: There's room for maneuverability. I think the idea was that Sekto was lying about the water: it wasn't spring water, it was river water. But if we wanted to say that Ma'Spa was just behind that dam, we could do that. It would make the liberation of Ma'Spa rather unceremonious, though.</p>
<p>Q: It's not necessarily cruel is it? If they kill them and use their hides? Native Americans had a 'harmonic' existence with nature but they still speared bison and used their skin to build their tents.</p>
<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: Absolutely, but for gameplay purposes you want to present the two forces as polar as opposite: absolute empathy against absolute barbarity. Video games make them both fun.</p>
<p>Q: You cannot leave it at "four temples".</p>
<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: I can! In fact the creatures themselves were in the very early stages of design at the point, so there's no answer to the question of "What was the fourth creature?" more than "Some scribblings with features that went into the other creatures' designs." The environments that each creature would inhabit kept changing, too. There was a point when 'Arachnid Sr.' was going to be an ice inhabitant and 'Arachnid Jr.' was the desert dweller. But at that point they weren't Scrabs and Paramites as we would recognize them today.</p>

<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: The volcano and/or jungle environment was for Meeches.</p>

<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: Nothing's set in stone until you see it in an official release. These in particular are such early and embryonic ideas that there's no need to try and subsume them into canon.</p>

<p>Q: A question for Wil or any other JAWers that might pop by: What's going on with Munch HD for PC?</p>
<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: Basically, the people who said they could get the PS3 version done in 6 months have so far spent over 2 years on it and it's still not done, so we're not letting them touch the PC version. That's about as far as the story goes at the moment.</p>

<p>Q: Were they the same people who ported SWHD?</p>
<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: No. JAW did everything for Stranger HD. JAW only did the art for Munch HD, not the programming.</p>

<p>Q: Wait... I thought Munch HD was already out on the PS3. No?</p>
<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: But there are a bunch of bugs, including one that prevents most people getting the Platinum Trophy (which, like, we get so much hate over, as though that's the only reason people play games), and the localizations aren't in (meaning we're not selling in half a dozes European stores). We were holding off advertising it at all until those things were quickly patched. That was coming up to 10 months ago. And then there's the Vita version.</p>

<p>Wil Bunce-Edwards: Munch HD is on PS3 in most regions but not all, coming to Vita soon.</p>
<p>Stranger HD is on PS3, Vita and PC, with a not-HD-but-using-some-of-the-improvements-anyway version coming to iOS, Android, Blackberry and Windows Phone soon.</p>
