<p>We at Magog on the March have been thinking about <em>Soulstorm</em> a lot over the past few days and have noticed a number of parallels and homages to pieces of lore that were dropped from finished games—notably <em>Munch's Oddysee</em>—or tidbits offered in interviews by Lorne Lanning over the years. We decided to whip up a curt image depicting all of the elements that we've come across.</p>

<p>Have we missed any?</p>
