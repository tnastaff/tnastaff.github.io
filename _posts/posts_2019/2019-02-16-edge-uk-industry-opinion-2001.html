<p><strong>Edge asks: what were your overall impressions of E3?</strong></p>
<p>This year's E3 was very successful for Oddworld. We came into the show thinking of it as a huge focus-testing opportunity as Microsoft was giving us great visibility and support. This gave us the opportunity to let hundreds of people get their hands on the controls of <em>Munch's Oddysee</em>. We kept watch of their reactions and gained a lot of useful feedback. The response was overwhelmingly positive.</p>
<p>For me, the highlight of the show was <em>Warcraft III</em>'s cinematics. They were absolutely astounding and massively epic in scale. The lowlight was seeing so much of the same old same old. The average game has stronger graphics and effects, but all in all it's the same old gameplay. I had hoped to see more on the creative front. Looking at the consoles for their technical performance and ability, at XBox there was a number of titles that showed smooth texture mapping, per-pixel shading, reflection mapping, and also bump mapping, realtime dynamic lighting, and realtime shadowcasting, smooth antialiasing. Sony is stilled plagued with image-artifact problems. Visual noise on virtually all of the game screens... even on their best titles out of Japan that have been being developed on dev stations for years now.</p>
<p>We were expecting more from Gamecube. We were expecting to see impressive dynamic lighting, but we didn't see any. Even in <em>Luigi's Castle </em>with those small rooms and with him carrying a flashhlight... no true dynamic lighting. We also didn't see shader complexity like we had expected. I don't recall any large-scale scenes that showed off how well mapping is handled with large distances. Miyamoto titles always show well, but the titles did not reveal hardware capabilities that we were expecting to see.<br />
