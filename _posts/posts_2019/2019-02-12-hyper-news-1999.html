<p><strong>OVERFLOW</strong></p>
<p>Oddworld Inhabitants, the creators of the Oddworld videogames - Abe's Oddysee, Abe's Exoddus and the forthcoming sequels, are planning a fully CGI feature film based on Abe and his fellow Mudokons. After submitting a short for Oscar consideration earlier this year, pre-production has already begun on what could be the first totally CGI, videogame related film. Unless Square get the Final Fantasy movie out first, that is.</p>
