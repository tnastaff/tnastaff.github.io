<p>The real showing for Munch's Oddysee at the E3 was behind closed doors. <strong>Oddworld Inhabitants</strong> has created a world with a fully functioning ecosystem in Munch. If you build a factory that uses a lot of wood, certain areas will suffer from deforestation and all the problems that result from it. The basic point is that every action has a realistic reaction within the virtual world. This game is going to be a real treat.</p>
