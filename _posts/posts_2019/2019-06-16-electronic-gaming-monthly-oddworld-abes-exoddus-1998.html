<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Time To Save The Mudokons Once Again</strong></p>
<p>It's an odd, Oddworld once again. Abe, the absinthe-skinned Mudokon and star of GT Interactive's Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee title, will soon be embarking on his second journey, picking up precisely where his last mission left off.</p>
<p>The story begins at the point where, by destroying the factory and all the Mudokon bones stashed inside (during the end of the first game), Abe has given the Glukkons reason to need another cache of bones so they can continue making their carnivorous beverages.</p>
<p>In Exoddus, you will again venture into the mission as Abe, only this time, with more feeling. Not only will Exoddus include more gamespeak and more special features (like invisibility), you will also reportedly discover more intelligent AI, and fellow Mudokons will wear their emotions on their skin, literally, as blue will depict melancholy, red will display anger, and so on. As Abe, you will have to interact with the Mudokons, by hugging and so forth, to keep them from committing suicide and even taking advantage of your kindness.</p>
<p>Zombified Mudokons, notably Mudombies, will need Abe's assistance in finding their way to safety as well.</p>
<p>Many of the former enemies, such as Scrabs and Sligs, will return. However, Fleeches, Slurgs, Necrum Spirits and Slogs will also attempt to keep you and your kind from safety. And while saving the Mudokons is foremost, there will be lots of chores for Abe along the way, so to speak.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, Abe can control an entire group of Mudokons at one time. Be warned, however: The Mudokons have volatile personalities. If you don't control them properly, they may throw a tantrum, or worse, commit suicide. Sounds like Tamagotchi, doesn't it?</p>
<hr />
<p>The game and graphics engine is unchanged from Abe's Oddysee, but the puzzles are all new. In fact, Abe's Exoddus has more than 700 new screens.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:center;">
Behind the Screens</h3>
<p><strong>The Next Oddysee</strong></p>
<p>You may know that Abe's Oddysee is part one of a quintology (that's a five-part series to you non-scientists out there). Abe's Exoddus is actually <em>not</em> part of this quintology. Part two of the series is going to be called Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee. Oddworld Inhabitants (the developers) have such a grand artistic vision for part two, they're waiting for a larger, more powerful canvas to paint on. "We definitely won't be doing Munch's Oddysee on the PlayStation," says Lorne Lanning, president of Oddworld Inhabitants. "We're going to wait for a more powerful system. Whether that system will be Dreamcast remains to be seen."</p>
<p>So where does Abe's Exoddus fit in all of this? GT Interactive knew that Oddworld Inhabitants weren't going to put Munch's Oddysee on the PlayStation. So GT basically explained to them that they'd be crazy not to do one more PlayStation Oddworld game, seeing how the first game met with such critical and financial success. Oddworld Inhabitants agreed, so now we have Abe's Exoddus.</p>
<p>Just remember, all of the games in the Oddworld quintology will have "Oddysee" in the title. Anything with "Exoddus" is considered outside of the quintology. Got it?</p>
