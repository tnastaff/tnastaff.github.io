<p><strong>PS2</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PlayStation2 made the biggest waves at this year's E3. The world of home entertainment is set for a major shake-up, and with October 26 just around the corner, <em>PSM</em> uncovered what the world's game publishers have up their sleeves. Stinkers aside, we're certain a lot of these titles will tickle your fancy! Read on, but we should warn you, you might not be able to sleep tonight...</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>(November 2000/Oddworld Inhabitants)</strong></p>
<p>One of the most imaginative and creatively different titles on show at this year's expo was the game starring that weird gangly little alien, Abe.</p>
<p><em>Munch's Oddysee</em> is the first game in the <em>Oddworld</em> series to be portrayed in full 3D, and even though it is very early days yet, the game was one of the standout offerings on display. Not that many of the show-goers got to see it properly... Oddworld Inhabitants only showed it behind rigidly guarded closed-door sessions. Luckily <em>PSM</em> was able to sneak a peek, and we've got to say that it's going to be a star performer on the PS2 when it's released.</p>
<p><em>Munch's Oddysee</em>'s offers a sense of imagination and vision that is not rivalled by many other titles. In an age where most games are about killing, shooting and using violent means to solve problems, <em>Munch</em> will actually reward the player if they use more creative means to deal with their problems. The final game ending will differ depending on how few enemies are killed, with a huge bonus ending if no one is killed and all goals have been achieved. As Lorne Lanning says, "Instead of throwing your enemies [sligs] into meat recycling bins which will kill them, you can choose to throw them in lockers, which removes them as a threat, but doesn't see anyone getting killed. As providers of content it is important to try and have a more nutritious sense of social values and refine games so that violence is not the only way of dealing with problems."</p>
<p>This is a key difference in <em>Munch</em>'s approach and it really does feel refreshing. The game will also see you trying to save the environment and stopping intergalactic capitalism and the enslavement of indigenous planetary populations, so there will be a management aspect to the game (which will see you planting trees and opening detox cafes to get critters addicted to vending machines food off the junk and back on to healthier alternatives).</p>
<p>All of this may sound rather politically righteous, but it looks great in the context of the gameplay, and the 3D platform action that will form the mainstay of the proceedings is looking colourful and enjoyable. Definitely the most innovative PS2 game at E3 this year, we'll take a closer look at <em>Munch's Oddysee</em> in the near future.</p>
