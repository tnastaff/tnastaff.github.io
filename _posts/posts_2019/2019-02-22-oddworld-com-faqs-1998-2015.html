<p><strong>We get a lot of email here at http://www.oddworld.com that ask many of the same things. So, to cut down on the size of our inboxes and to help you get the answers you need, we've assembled this FAQ (list of frequently asked questions and their answers). Take a look at the list below ... odds are, you'll find the info you need.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: "When is Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus for the PC coming out?"</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> It will either be out by Christmas or by early the following week.</p>
<p><strong>Q: "How does Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus fit into the whole Oddworld Quintology thingee?"</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> OK, here's the dilly (if I may use the vernacular): There are going to be FIVE main games in the Quintology (hence the 'quint'). Each of these main, five games will introduce a new character. The first game in the Quintology was Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. The second game in the Quintology will be Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee. In between Quintology installments, there will be so-called "bonus games." Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus in one of these bonus games. Essentially, these bonus games use a modified version of the game engine that precedes it. So Abe's Exoddus uses a modified version of the Abe's Oddysee engine; if a bonus game is made between Munch's Oddysee and the next installment of the Quintology, it will use a modified version of Munch's engine. So you see, it's not nearly as complex as it might sound at first.</p>
<p><strong>Q: "What is Quintology's plot?"</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Good things come to those who wait...that story will be revealed in the games as they're released. To find out about the story thus far, head over to Oddworld Universe and do a little poking around.</p>
<p><strong>Q: "I'm stuck in (insert name of Oddworld game here) and I need help!"</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> You have several options. First, go check out the "Hints and Tips" section of the game you're having difficulty with. There, you'll find some selected tips and info on how to order the Strategy Guide from 800-610-GTIS, or through the on-line store at http://www.gtstore.com. There's also a 900 Hint Line number of 900-CALL-2GT if you need a hint immediately !!</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">You can also head over to http://www.gtisonline.com and go to your game's page. SOMETIMES (stress on the 'some'), they'll post hints, tips, and cheats over there. Just remember that cheats/hints/tips aren't their official gig, so they might have some stuff and they might not. The important thing to remember is that we here at http://www.oddworld.com simply don't have the time or resources to answer the countless requests we get for game help, so if you email us asking for that type of info, don't be offended if you don't receive a reply.</p>
<p><strong>Q: "I want cheats for (insert name of Oddworld game here)!"</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Same as above.</p>
<p><strong>Q: "What can you tell me about Munch?"</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> "Aside from the fact that he's the character upon whom the next installment of the Quintology is based, nothing. But keep your eyes peeled on http://www.oddworld.com over the course of 1999 for more info as it becomes available.</p>
<p><strong>Q: "Why don't you make (insert name of Oddworld game here) for the (insert name of favorite gaming console here)?"</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The high quality art we use, in conjunction with complex Artificial Intelligence and GameSpeak, requires TONS of memory. If a gaming platform can't handle our memory requirements, we can't make games for it.</p>
<p><strong>Q: "What consoles of the future (i.e. DreamCast, the next game console from Sony, Nintendo, etc.) will Oddworld games support?"</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Too early to say.</p>
<p><strong>Q: "What happened to 'Dear Lorne'?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> His first batch of responses to user mail would have landed us in court for the duration of the Oddworld Quintology, so our wise Web Monkey decided to ax it. But never fear! We've replaced that section with "Dear Alf."</p>
<p><strong>Q: "Who the heck is Alf?"</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Alf is the proprietor of Alf's Rehab and Tea, the establishment you become familiar with during the course of Abe's Exoddus. As the owner of this place, Alf has seen just about every problem you can imagine...and has the advice to prove it!</p>
<p><strong>Q: "I have a game idea. Will you look at it?"</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> For a whole bunch of legal reasons, we cant' accept unsolicited game ideas. If you want a chance to work with us, your best bet is to check out our "Jobs" page.</p>
<p><strong>Q: "Why hasn't Lorne/Alf/Glenn/Damian, et. al. written back to me?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We get THOUSANDS of emails every week, so we obviously can't respond to them all. The only letters sent to "dearalf@gtinteractive.com" that will get a response are the ones that get posted on the site. Requests for game help sent to other http://www.oddworld.com personnel simply can't be addressed (see the first Q in the FAQ). We need to focus our energies on responding to emails that are either site-content related or tech-related.</p>
<p><strong>Q: "I'm having technical problems with (insert name of Oddworld DEMO here). Help!"</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> While we will do everything in our power to make sure that demos go up as problem-free as possible, please understand that all demos released here are unsupported betas. This means a couplea' things. First, they haven't gone through the stringent QA to which the final version of the game will be subjected. Second, we haven't hired tech support people to assist users of the demo. If you're having MAJOR issues with a demo that can be repeated, then certainly feel free to email one of the site's staff with the problem and as much info as possible. While we can't promise the problem will be fixed, we'll certainly investigate and let you know if we come to any kind of solution for you.</p>
<p><strong>Q: "I'm having technical problems with (insert name of Oddworld FINAL, STORE-BOUGHT GAME here). Help!"</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> This is a definite job for GT Technical Support. Head over to http://www.gtisonline.com and take a look around...you'll most likely find your answer there. If not, you can email one of the helpful Tech Support Specialists.</p>
<p><strong>Q: "Will there ever be an Oddworld movie?"</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> As far as a feature-length, full blown film is concerned, Oddworld plans to make all of the Quintology into full CG motion pictures. There are no other details that can be mentioned at this time except this: THINK BIG!</p>
<p><strong>Q: "Will there ever be an Oddworld line of toys?"</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> There are no plans for a toy line at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Q: "I think Glenn Broderick is a real jerk."</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Join the club.</p>
<p><strong>Q: "I think Online Marketing Specialist, Damian Bruno, is so money."</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Lay off the SoulStorm Brew.</p>
<p><strong>Q: "Can you send me free games?"</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> No. But you can check out <a href="http://www.oddworld.com/shock/odd_universe_po_index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Playing the Odds</a> (scheduled to go live any day now) and take a look at some of the cool contests we're running.</p>
<p><strong>Q: "Who does Abe's voice?"</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Lorne Lanning. He also does the voices for MANY of the games' other characters. He has been seeing a therapist about this, but to date there are no signs of a cure.</p>

<p><strong>Q: When is Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee going to be released?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Munch's Oddysee will release with the launch of the Xbox. The U.S. launch is scheduled for Fall 2001. The European launch is scheduled for first quarter 2002. As soon as we have information on the Australian launch, we'll let you know!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will Munch's Oddysee be on the PS2?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> No. Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee is an exclusive Xbox title.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will Munch be released for the PC?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Oddworld is concentrating entirely on the Xbox version. The creation of a PC version has yet to be determined. As soon as we find out, we'll post it.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will Oddworld merchandise be available?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Oddworld is always looking for licensing opportunities but as of yet have not signed any deals. It is certainly in our future plans, but we are looking to do it at the right time with the right folks.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there going to be a PlayStation 2 or Gamecube version of any Oddworld games?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Oddworld Inhabitants has no plans to create any PS2 or Gamecube games in-house. However, if a PS2 or Gamecube game concept is proposed to us by another publisher or developer we may choose to license our "world" to them for development.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why cancel the PS2 version completely?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> What really tipped the scales, is we're not developing the ALIVE 2ª engine just to run Munch but the next in the series of Oddworld games and we had to make a major technology and design decision for the franchise and our company. The reality is, making great games takes a lot of time and the investment and commitment of teams of talented people dedicated to a common vision. We felt the we were fighting an uphill battle that was compromising and would continue to compromise our vision for where Oddworld was to go in the 128bit era. With Xbox our vision would not only stay in tact but instead of focusing our people to tackle constant technology issues we could dedicate our resources to making better gaming experiences. After the trials and tribulations of working on Munch for the last 18 months, the decision, at the end of the day, wasn't a difficult one. To make the game and the foreseeable future games we want to make, Xbox is the right home for Oddworld.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I need help with Abe's Oddysee or Abe's Exoddus. Where can I go?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The best place to go it to our forum and ask the other fans for help. The forum on www.oddworldian.net &amp; www.oddworld.au.com is also an excellent source.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I find copies of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee &amp; Abe's Exoddus?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately, we can't give you a good source to find our previous games in either PC or PSX format. With the change of publishers from GT to Infogrames our games have not been restock in some time. We are currently investigating what can be done. We will keep you posted.</p>
<p><strong>Q: In the game I noticed that in the first game Abe and Mudokons have 4 fingers then in Abe's Exoddus they have only 3 fingers. What happened with the 4th finger?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Well, it's a long story that needs to be told. So here it is... Japan has a strict discriminating policy against any simulated characters entering their country with four fingers. Historically, Japan has had a subclass of meat packing workers that were typically looked down upon in their society. In later days, the blatant displaying of a four fingered hand gesture, intentionally directed at another, came to mean that you were calling them a member of the meat packing sub class. Which, we understand, was not at all a compliment.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It appears that the four finger connection with the meat packing class was due to work related accidents, but was so frequent that it came to symbolically represent the sub class. It seems as though this is a part of the Japanese history that some groups within Japan would like to see forgotten. Therefore, it is at great risk that you publish four fingered characters in Japan, as you may very likely end up in legal battles with a vociferous pressure group. This group claims that this type of representation is equivalent to and as degrading as the yellow star forced to be worn on Jews by the Nazi's during the Second World War.That is, it's offensive and degrading unless they can extort enough money out of you. Then it's all okay. Case in point: We were told that the Walt Disney Corporation is charged five million dollars a year by this group so that Mickey Mouse may live in Japan and retain his original four fingered design. Otherwise, old Mickey would need to see a surgeon and have something done about that insulting forth finger.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The moral of this story is... if you want to pay, then it's ok. If you don't want to pay, then it's a horrible insult to our culture. In other parts of the world we have a word for these types of two-faced tactics. We call it extortion. If it is truly offensive and degrading, then don't allow it at all. But to allow it for a price... is to belittle the case altogether. It suggests that the real truth behind these groups is that they are using the darker moments in their own cultures' history as an excuse to coerce money out of content providers.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Well, being that this is Oddworld, we felt that this seemed like a perfect addition to the Abe story. We thought it was ironically perfect that he was being discriminated against for being who he was. As the message came from Japan, "They don't like his kind here, with the sincere suggestion," Just chop off one of his fingers cause you don't have the money to pay up..." caused us to feel that we indeed needed to allow Abe to go through the suffering that goes along with being a poor slob at the bottom of the Food chain. Yup, we chopped off his finger so that the Japanese wouldn't get offended (or paid). He didn't like it one bit, but due to the fact that their ain't much he can do about it... we decided that he could donate his finger rather than us donating five million dollars. Such is life in Japan when you're a four-fingered meat packing worker.<br />
And that is how Abe lost his finger in Japan. He's still pretty pissed off about it, but we convinced him that with the amount of games sold in Japan, he still might be able to get his message through to their culture someday. As a true believer in his cause, he felt that the sacrifice of a finger was but a small price to pay in hoping to shed some light on discriminations and injustices the world over.</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We have a lot of desire to merchandise the property, but we've been slow on the licensing front because we want to be careful and make sure we're making the right moves for the property.<br />

<p><strong>Q: Why cancel the PS2 version completely?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q: I need help with Oddworld games. Where can I go?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The fan forums on www.oddworld.au.com is an excellent source for information on solving puzzles, etc. The forums are independent from OWI.

<p><strong>Q: Where can I find copies of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee &amp; Abe's Exoddus?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately, we can't give you a good source to find our previous games in either PC or PSX format. With the change of publishers from GT to Infogrames our games have not been restocked in some time.We're usually not that big into endorsements, but Amazon.com is your sure bet on this one. both Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus are difficult to find in stores these days: some people buy/sell them on eBay too, so that's another source. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Q: In the game I noticed that in the first game Abe and Mudokons have 4 fingers then in Abe's Exoddus they have only 3 fingers. What happened with the 4th finger?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q: Many fans are wondering about SoBe vending machines in the game. What prompted the decision to include SoBe vending machines ?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, there will be a couple of Sobe vendos inside the final version of the game. SoBe was very excited about promoting Munch's Oddysee along with the SoBe / Xbox road show. SoBe liked the message of our content and very much liked the quirky humor and irony of our universe. The vendo's appeared in the game as an exchange for the opportunity to be a part of the sneak peak SoBe / Xbox road show that gave the public an early opportunity to put Munch and the Xbox in their hands.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Whenever a co-promotional opportunity arises, Oddworld's first order of business is to see if there are any outstanding labor or environmental issues with the potential co-sponsor. Not only did SoBe come up clean in our search, but they have also demonstrated historic efforts to try to raise the nutritious quality of the average mass market soft drink.</p>

So even though it is unlike anything we've released so far, we think you'll agree it couldn't have come from anyone but Oddworld.</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The fan forums on www.oddworld.au.com is an excellent source for information on solving puzzles, etc. The forums are independent from OWI. For Technical Support for Munch's Oddysee, www.xbox.com is your one stop resource for everything to do with Xbox.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I find copies of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee &amp; Abe's Exoddus?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately, we can't give you a good source to find our previous games in either PC or PSX format. With the change of publishers from GT to Infogrames our games have not been restocked in some time.We're usually not that big into endorsements, but Amazon.com is your sure bet on this one. both Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus are difficult to find in stores these days: some people buy/sell them on eBay too, so that's another source. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Q: In the game I noticed that in the first game Abe and Mudokons have 4 fingers then in Abe's Exoddus they have only 3 fingers. What happened with the 4th finger?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Well, it's a long story that needs to be told. So here it is... Japan has a strict discriminating policy against any simulated characters entering their country with four fingers. Historically, Japan has had a subclass of meat packing workers that were typically looked down upon in their society. In later days, the blatant displaying of a four fingered hand gesture, intentionally directed at another, came to mean that you were calling them a member of the meat packing sub class. Which, we understand, was not at all a compliment.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It appears that the four finger connection with the meat packing class was due to work related accidents, but was so frequent that it came to symbolically represent the sub class. It seems as though this is a part of the Japanese history that some groups within Japan would like to see forgotten. Therefore, it is at great risk that you publish four fingered characters in Japan, as you may very likely end up in legal battles with a vociferous pressure group. This group claims that this type of representation is equivalent to and as degrading as the yellow star forced to be worn on Jews by the Nazi's during the Second World War.That is, it's offensive and degrading unless they can extort enough money out of you. Then it's all okay. Case in point: We were told that the Walt Disney Corporation is charged five million dollars a year by this group so that Mickey Mouse may live in Japan and retain his original four fingered design. Otherwise, old Mickey would need to see a surgeon and have something done about that insulting forth finger.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The moral of this story is... if you want to pay, then it's ok. If you don't want to pay, then it's a horrible insult to our culture. In other parts of the world we have a word for these types of two-faced tactics. We call it extortion. If it is truly offensive and degrading, then don't allow it at all. But to allow it for a price... is to belittle the case altogether. It suggests that the real truth behind these groups is that they are using the darker moments in their own cultures' history as an excuse to coerce money out of content providers.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Well, being that this is Oddworld, we felt that this seemed like a perfect addition to the Abe story. We thought it was ironically perfect that he was being discriminated against for being who he was. As the message came from Japan, "They don't like his kind here, with the sincere suggestion," Just chop off one of his fingers cause you don't have the money to pay up..." caused us to feel that we indeed needed to allow Abe to go through the suffering that goes along with being a poor slob at the bottom of the Food chain. Yup, we chopped off his finger so that the Japanese wouldn't get offended (or paid). He didn't like it one bit, but due to the fact that their ain't much he can do about it... we decided that he could donate his finger rather than us donating five million dollars. Such is life in Japan when you're a four-fingered meat packing worker.<br />
And that is how Abe lost his finger in Japan. He's still pretty pissed off about it, but we convinced him that with the amount of games sold in Japan, he still might be able to get his message through to their culture someday. As a true believer in his cause, he felt that the sacrifice of a finger was but a small price to pay in hoping to shed some light on discriminations and injustices the world over.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Many fans are wondering about SoBe vending machines in the game. What prompted the decision to include SoBe vending machines ?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, there will be a couple of Sobe vendos inside the final version of the game. SoBe was very excited about promoting Munch's Oddysee along with the SoBe / Xbox road show. SoBe liked the message of our content and very much liked the quirky humor and irony of our universe. The vendo's appeared in the game as an exchange for the opportunity to be a part of the sneak peak SoBe / Xbox road show that gave the public an early opportunity to put Munch and the Xbox in their hands.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Whenever a co-promotional opportunity arises, Oddworld's first order of business is to see if there are any outstanding labor or environmental issues with the potential co-sponsor. Not only did SoBe come up clean in our search, but they have also demonstrated historic efforts to try to raise the nutritious quality of the average mass market soft drink.</p>

<p><strong>The Most Frequently Asked Questions.</strong> <em>(last update: June 2003)</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: What ever happened to Hand of Odd, Munch's Exoddus and/or Squeek's Oddysee?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We are currently not in production on those titles at this time. Oddworld is presently working on a title that is concurrent with the evolution of the Quintology, but unique from our previous games. So even though it is unlike anything we've released so far, we think you'll agree it couldn't have come from anyone but Oddworld.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When is the next Oddworld coming out for XBox? I absolutely loved Munch's Oddysee and I was just wondering when the next one was coming out.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The specific release date for our fourth (untitled) game has yet to be finalized, but we're on track for a release in 2004.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When is Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee going to be released?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Munch's Oddysee was released with the launch of the Xbox in November 15th 2001.<br />
The European and Australian launch took place in March 2002.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will Munch's Oddysee be on the PS2?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> No. Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee is an exclusive Xbox title.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will Munch be released for the PC?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> There are no plans to release Munch's Oddysee for the PC.<br />
We are focusing our energy on creating the next title for the Xbox exclusively.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will Oddworld merchandise be available? What about an Oddworld movie?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We have a lot of desire to merchandise the property, but we've been slow on the licensing front because we want to be careful and make sure we're making the right moves for the property.<br />
Our artistic dreams definitely include motion pictures. These ideas began as motion pictures for us. When the films can be done the way we want to do them... only then we will move forward with production.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there going to be a PlayStation 2 or Gamecube version of any Oddworld games?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Oddworld Inhabitants has no plans to create any PS2 or Gamecube games in-house. However, if a PS2 or Gamecube game concept is proposed to us by another publisher or developer we may choose to license our "world" to them for development.</p>
<p><strong>Q: You say that Munch is exclusive to the Xbox yet it has been reported to be released on GameBoy Advance?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes. An adaptation of Munch's Oddysee is being developed for the GameBoy Advance. Oddworld Inhabitants will not be producing the GameBoy version.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why cancel the PS2 version completely?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> What really tipped the scales, is we're not developing the ALIVE 2ª engine just to run Munch but the next in the series of Oddworld games and we had to make a major technology and design decision for the franchise and our company. The reality is, making great games takes a lot of time and the investment and commitment of teams of talented people dedicated to a common vision. We felt the we were fighting an uphill battle that was compromising and would continue to compromise our vision for where Oddworld was to go in the 128bit era. With Xbox our vision would not only stay in tact but instead of focusing our people to tackle constant technology issues we could dedicate our resources to making better gaming experiences. After the trials and tribulations of working on Munch for the last 18 months, the decision, at the end of the day, wasn't a difficult one. To make the game and the foreseeable future games we want to make, Xbox is the right home for Oddworld.</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The specific release date for our fourth game has yet to be finalized but we expect a 1st quarter 2005 date for both Xbox and PS2&gt;<a href="http://oddworld.com/oddworld/pr/pr061704.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the official press release</a></p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes. The Art of Oddworld Inhabitants, the First Ten Years will be published by Ballistic Publishing for Sept/Oct 2004. For more info: www.ballisticpublishing.com<br />
Our artistic dreams definitely include motion pictures. These ideas began as motion pictures for us. When the films can be done the way we want to do them... only then we will move forward with production.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I need help with Oddworld games. Where can I go?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The fan forums on www.oddworld.au.com is an excellent source for information on solving puzzles, etc. The forums are independent from OWI. For Technical Support for Munch's Oddysee, www.xbox.com is your one stop resource for everything to do with Xbox.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I find copies of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee &amp; Abe's Exoddus?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately, we can't give you a good source to find our previous games in either PC or PSX format. With the change of publishers from GT to Infogrames our games have not been restocked in some time.We're usually not that big into endorsements, but Amazon.com is your sure bet on this one. both Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus are difficult to find in stores these days: some people buy/sell them on eBay too, so that's another source. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Q: In the game I noticed that in the first game Abe and Mudokons have 4 fingers then in Abe's Exoddus they have only 3 fingers. What happened with the 4th finger?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Well, it's a long story that needs to be told. So here it is... Japan has a strict discriminating policy against any simulated characters entering their country with four fingers. Historically, Japan has had a subclass of meat packing workers that were typically looked down upon in their society. In later days, the blatant displaying of a four fingered hand gesture, intentionally directed at another, came to mean that you were calling them a member of the meat packing sub class. Which, we understand, was not at all a compliment.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It appears that the four finger connection with the meat packing class was due to work related accidents, but was so frequent that it came to symbolically represent the sub class. It seems as though this is a part of the Japanese history that some groups within Japan would like to see forgotten. Therefore, it is at great risk that you publish four fingered characters in Japan, as you may very likely end up in legal battles with a vociferous pressure group. This group claims that this type of representation is equivalent to and as degrading as the yellow star forced to be worn on Jews by the Nazi's during the Second World War.That is, it's offensive and degrading unless they can extort enough money out of you. Then it's all okay. Case in point: We were told that the Walt Disney Corporation is charged five million dollars a year by this group so that Mickey Mouse may live in Japan and retain his original four fingered design. Otherwise, old Mickey would need to see a surgeon and have something done about that insulting forth finger.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The moral of this story is... if you want to pay, then it's ok. If you don't want to pay, then it's a horrible insult to our culture. In other parts of the world we have a word for these types of two-faced tactics. We call it extortion. If it is truly offensive and degrading, then don't allow it at all. But to allow it for a price... is to belittle the case altogether. It suggests that the real truth behind these groups is that they are using the darker moments in their own cultures' history as an excuse to coerce money out of content providers.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Well, being that this is Oddworld, we felt that this seemed like a perfect addition to the Abe story. We thought it was ironically perfect that he was being discriminated against for being who he was. As the message came from Japan, "They don't like his kind here, with the sincere suggestion," Just chop off one of his fingers cause you don't have the money to pay up..." caused us to feel that we indeed needed to allow Abe to go through the suffering that goes along with being a poor slob at the bottom of the Food chain. Yup, we chopped off his finger so that the Japanese wouldn't get offended (or paid). He didn't like it one bit, but due to the fact that their ain't much he can do about it... we decided that he could donate his finger rather than us donating five million dollars. Such is life in Japan when you're a four-fingered meat packing worker.<br />
And that is how Abe lost his finger in Japan. He's still pretty pissed off about it, but we convinced him that with the amount of games sold in Japan, he still might be able to get his message through to their culture someday. As a true believer in his cause, he felt that the sacrifice of a finger was but a small price to pay in hoping to shed some light on discriminations and injustices the world over.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Many fans are wondering about SoBe vending machines in the game. What prompted the decision to include SoBe vending machines ?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, there will be a couple of Sobe vendos inside the final version of the game. SoBe was very excited about promoting Munch's Oddysee along with the SoBe / Xbox road show. SoBe liked the message of our content and very much liked the quirky humor and irony of our universe. The vendo's appeared in the game as an exchange for the opportunity to be a part of the sneak peak SoBe / Xbox road show that gave the public an early opportunity to put Munch and the Xbox in their hands.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Whenever a co-promotional opportunity arises, Oddworld's first order of business is to see if there are any outstanding labor or environmental issues with the potential co-sponsor. Not only did SoBe come up clean in our search, but they have also demonstrated historic efforts to try to raise the nutritious quality of the average mass market soft drink.</p>

<p><strong>The Most Frequently Asked Questions.</strong> <em>(last update: February 2005)</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: When is Oddworld Stranger's Wrath coming out?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Our fourth title, Oddworld Stranger's Wrath is in stores on January 25th in the U.S. and March 3rd in Europe and Australia exclusively for the Xbox.</p>
<p><strong>Q: My "Movies of Oddworld" Pre-order DVD won't let me play the Stranger's Wrath movie. What's up with that?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We've recently learned that there is a small issue with our recently released "Movies of Oddworld" Bonus DVD. The second chapter in the Oddworld Stranger's Wrath section, which is the opening movie from the game, will not play if you access it from the "Chapter Select" menu. To avoid this problem choose "Play All" from the menu, or watch the first chapter and then allow the second chapter to play normally afterward.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is the "Movies of Oddworld" DVD available as a preorder item in Europe? If so, what stores will have it?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We are currently not in production on those titles at this time. While EA originally intended the Movies of Oddworld DVD to be a pre-order item in the U.K., France and Germany, they have decided to use the DVD's in other various promotions. For more information, please contact your country's eagames.com website.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why isn't this website updated anymore? You used to have monthly updates in the fan section. There isn't anything new in the Oddworld Universe section either. Will you ever add the new characters in the Universe section?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We are a small developer without a full time webmaster. We try to do our best but game production takes a priority. In fact, we plan on stopping monthly updates for awhile. In the meantime, please visit our publishers websites. They have tons of information on our games. www.eagames.com for Oddworld Stranger's Wrath and www.xbox.com for Munch's Oddysee.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will Oddworld merchandise be available? What about an Oddworld movie?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> "The Art of Oddworld Inhabitants, the First Ten Years" published by Ballistic Publishing is available online now. For more info: www.ballisticpublishing.com</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Our artistic dreams definitely include motion pictures. These ideas began as motion pictures for us. When the films can be done the way we want to do them... only then we will move forward with production.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why can't I buy the Art of Oddworld book at Amazon.com or my local Barnes and Noble?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Ballistic Publishing is a small publisher in Australia. We chose to work with Ballistic for their high standards of quality. Unfortunately they are not able to supply big chain stores books unless they are purchased first.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will Munch's Oddysee or Oddworld Stranger's Wrath be on the PC or PS2?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> No. There are no plans for a PS2 or PC version of these games.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I need help with Oddworld games. Where can I go?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The fan forums on www.oddworldforums.net is an excellent source for information on solving puzzles, etc. The forums are independent from OWI. For Technical Support for Munch's Oddysee, www.xbox.com is your one stop resource for everything to do with Xbox.<br />
For technical help with Oddworld Stranger's Wrath, contact our publisher Electronic Arts at the customer support section of www.eagames.com.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What ever happened to Hand of Odd, Munch's Exoddus and/or Squeek's Oddysee?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We are currently not in production on those titles at this time.<br />
Oddworld has just launched it's fourth game Oddworld Stranger's Wrath.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I find copies of the previous Oddworld games?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately, we can't give you a good source to find our previous games in either PC or PSX format. With the change of publishers from GT to Infogrames our games have not been restocked in some time. We're usually not that big into endorsements, but Amazon.com is your sure bet on this one. both Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus are difficult to find in stores these days: some people buy/sell them on eBay too, so that's another source. Try the used game section of your local game store too. Munch's Oddysee is part of the Xbox Platinum Hits and can be found in stores. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Q: In the game I noticed that in the first game Abe and Mudokons have 4 fingers then in Abe's Exoddus they have only 3 fingers. What happened with the 4th finger?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Well, it's a long story that needs to be told. So here it is... Japan has a strict discriminating policy against any simulated characters entering their country with four fingers. Historically, Japan has had a subclass of meat packing workers that were typically looked down upon in their society. In later days, the blatant displaying of a four fingered hand gesture, intentionally directed at another, came to mean that you were calling them a member of the meat packing sub class. Which, we understand, was not at all a compliment.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It appears that the four finger connection with the meat packing class was due to work related accidents, but was so frequent that it came to symbolically represent the sub class. It seems as though this is a part of the Japanese history that some groups within Japan would like to see forgotten. Therefore, it is at great risk that you publish four fingered characters in Japan, as you may very likely end up in legal battles with a vociferous pressure group. This group claims that this type of representation is equivalent to and as degrading as the yellow star forced to be worn on Jews by the Nazi's during the Second World War.That is, it's offensive and degrading unless they can extort enough money out of you. Then it's all okay. Case in point: We were told that the Walt Disney Corporation is charged five million dollars a year by this group so that Mickey Mouse may live in Japan and retain his original four fingered design. Otherwise, old Mickey would need to see a surgeon and have something done about that insulting forth finger.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The moral of this story is... if you want to pay, then it's ok. If you don't want to pay, then it's a horrible insult to our culture. In other parts of the world we have a word for these types of two-faced tactics. We call it extortion. If it is truly offensive and degrading, then don't allow it at all. But to allow it for a price... is to belittle the case altogether. It suggests that the real truth behind these groups is that they are using the darker moments in their own cultures' history as an excuse to coerce money out of content providers.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Well, being that this is Oddworld, we felt that this seemed like a perfect addition to the Abe story. We thought it was ironically perfect that he was being discriminated against for being who he was. As the message came from Japan, "They don't like his kind here, with the sincere suggestion," Just chop off one of his fingers cause you don't have the money to pay up..." caused us to feel that we indeed needed to allow Abe to go through the suffering that goes along with being a poor slob at the bottom of the Food chain.

As a true believer in his cause, he felt that the sacrifice of a finger was but a small price to pay in hoping to shed some light on discriminations and injustices the world over.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Many fans are wondering about SoBe vending machines in Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee. What prompted the decision to include SoBe vending machines ?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, there will be a couple of Sobe vendos inside the final version of the game. SoBe was very excited about promoting Munch's Oddysee along with the SoBe / Xbox road show. SoBe liked the message of our content and very much liked the quirky humor and irony of our universe.

<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: When trying to download Stranger’s Wrath I get the error message “This game is currently unavailable. Please try again another time."?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> You must download and install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package, either <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x86</a> if your system is 32-bit, or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=BD2A6171-E2D6-4230-B809-9A8D7548C1B6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x64</a> if your system is 64-bit. This will solve the problem, although you may have to reboot Steam or your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The graphics in Stranger’s Wrath are corrupted on my ATI graphics card.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately we are victim of bugs within ATI’s OpenGL drivers. To solve the problem of NPCs sticking in a ‘T-position’, download the latest drivers for your graphics card. ATI’s engineers are working on the other bugs now and they will release updated drivers that will fix other graphical glitches in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Stranger’s Wrath game crashes on the loading screen on my Nvidia graphics board.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Disable any multi-threading options enabled in your Nvidia nView control panel.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I become unable to move Stranger in Stranger’s Wrath.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Make sure that you have ‘vsync’ enabled in the game’s launcher.</p>
<p><strong>Q: My Oddboxx game still isn’t working, can you help me?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Make sure you meet the minimum system requirements for running the game in question, and ensure you read the support text that has been posted on the <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=447" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam forums</a>. If you’re still experiencing technical problems, <a href="http://www.oddworld.com/?page_id=351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">email tech support</a> with a good description of your troubles and details of your computer specs.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you release non-English translations of your games?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Abe’s Oddysee and Abe’s Exoddus are already available on Steam in FIGS (French, Italian, German and Spanish) and Japanese (for AO only). These are the only languages the PC ports were released in, so they are the only ones that will be available.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The FIGS versions of Munch’s Oddysee HD and Stranger’s Wrath HD for PS3 will be subtitles-only. This is because multiple translations of the FMVs would require vastly bigger downloads and it’s not possible to filter what files are downloaded from PSN. In addition, Italian and Spanish audio was never recorded.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We’ve yet to pin down how localization of Munch HD and Stranger HD for PC will be handled, but the FIGS subtitles will be made available.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will Stranger’s Wrath HD and Munch’s Oddysee HD be released?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Stranger’s Wrath HD for PS3 will deliver in late November or early December, but we cannot give a final release date until the game has passed Sony QA because this takes an unspecified amount of time. It’s looking perfectly possible that Munch’s Oddysee HD for PS3 will not be released in 2011. Our attitude is “when it’s done”.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For PC, the HD remasters are free updates for existing customers that will be available 6–8 weeks after the PS3 releases.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For PS Vita we are hoping to be launch titles in America and Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you be releasing your games on Mac/Xbox 360/[insert platform here]?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We are a platform agnostic developer, no longer building games for any specific system, and we’ll always looks to bring out projects on multiple platforms. We have to be realistic and consider how easy it would be to do that, how well the game would play on that system, and how many sales we’d see from it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We would love to release Oddworld on Mac, but can’t confirm it will happen.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Unfortunately, Stranger’s Wrath HD exceeds the 2GB limit on XBLA titles, and we’re unable to publish via Games on Demand because we haven’t published two disc products (Stranger and Munch were originally published by other companies). We have not given up and are in ongoing communication with Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there ever be new Oddworld games?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes! Once Stranger’s Wrath HD and Munch’s Oddysee HD are complete, we will start production on two new titles, Oddworld: The Hand of Odd and something we’re calling Abe HD.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Looking further into the future we hope to return to other unreleased projects (SligStorm and The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot), including the long-awaited continuation of the Oddworld Quintology with Squeek’s Oddysee. It is far too early to start talking about these or any other future plans.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell me about Abe HD?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> News of Abe HD was let slip to the public a lot earlier than we were anticipating; we are not ready to start talking about it properly and we haven’t yet started production on it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It will be 2.5D: gameplay will be 2D, but graphics will be 3D.<br />
Gameplay will be smooth-scrolling, not screen-scrolling like Abe’s Oddysee.<br />
Cut-scenes will be rendered in realtime, not pre-rendered like Abe’s Oddysee.<br />
We haven’t decided whether to make Abe’s Oddysee, Abe’s Exoddus, something new, or a combination of the above.<br />
It will be released at the end of 2012 at the earliest.<br />
Platforms are not yet determined.<br />
It will not be part of the Oddboxx or a free update for existing Abe’s Oddysee and Abe’s Exoddus customers: this is an entirely new game engine constructed virtually from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell me about Hand of Odd?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Hand of Odd was originally conceived and announced in the 1990s as a relatively typical RTS game, and a hugely detailed 4-inch-thick design document already exists. We will be reworking the existing designs to suit the emergent social gaming environment.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">When we talk about taking inspiration from Zynga, we are talking about the ‘freemium’ business model, NOT their games. Hand of Odd will NOT be like FarmVille or CityVille. What we are saying is that it will be free to play, but there will be monetized elements. Beyond that, we can’t comment on gameplay, platforms or other details because they’re not set in stone. Hand of Odd will hopefully deliver in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will you make your next announcement?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> When we’re good and ready. Sit down and shaddap already!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I get Oddworld merchandise?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The Art of Oddworld Inhabitants is our first art book, published by the fine folks at Ballistic Publishing. You can still buy the hard cover edition, limited edition and folio edition from <a href="http://www.ballisticpublishing.com/books/oddworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their website</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The composer of Stranger’s Wrath, Michael Bross, has released an album of music from the game. This soundtrack is available from<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=259688681&amp;id=259688413&amp;s=143441&amp;uo=6%22%3E%3Cimg%20height=%2215%22%20width=%2261%22%20alt=%22Michael%20Bross%20-%20Music%20from%20Oddworld:%20Stranger&amp;#39%3Bs%20Wrath,%20Vol.%201%22%20src=%22http://ax.itunes.apple.com/images/badgeitunes61x15dark.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> iTunes</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W4C87W?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=michaelbross-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B000W4C87W" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">You can now purchase a <a href="http://www.littlebigplanet.com/en/game_guide/ps3/downloadable_content/stranger_costume/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stranger costume</a> for Sackboy in LittleBigPlanet 2! Hopefully more Oddworld characters will be coming in the future!</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In the very near future you’ll be able to buy two Oddworld T-shirts from <a href="http://www.insertcoinclothing.com/blog/Its%20an%20Oddworld%20after%20all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insert Coin Clothing</a>! If these tees prove popular, more designs will follow!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you be bringing back old features from the previous Oddworld Inhabitants website?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We’ve already reopened Alf’s Rehab &amp; Tea because it’s important to us that we maintain contact with our fans. There will be downloadable wallpapers and other goodies in the coming months.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We are a small company without a dedicated web department. We all pitch in with content for the website when we can find the time, but our focus has to the be the games. We apologize in advance if the website isn’t updated enough for your liking.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why hasn’t my comment been approved on Oddworld.com?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Alf handles most of the comments on Oddworld.com, and he can be a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to answering questions. You may have to wait until he’s happy with his answer before he approves your comment.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Alternatively, your question might be in line to appear in the next Dear Alf, or it might be a frequently asked question that Alf’s tired of answering.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who is Alf?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Alf is our liaison with the fans. He was introduced in Abe’s Exoddus as Abe’s friend who followed him through the desert. Alf went on to open Alf’s Rehab &amp; Tea, where Mudokons sick from SoulStorm Brew come seeking rehabilitation, and where Oddworld fans come seeking answers to their questions.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do Mudokons have four fingers on each hand in Abe’s Oddysee but only three in Abe’s Exoddus?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Well, it’s a long story that needs to be told. So here it is… Japan has a strict discriminating policy against any simulated characters entering their country with four fingers. Historically, Japan has had a subclass of meat packing workers that were typically looked down upon in their society. In later days, the blatant displaying of a four fingered hand gesture, intentionally directed at another, came to mean that you were calling them a member of the meat packing sub class. Which, we understand, was not at all a compliment.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It appears that the four finger connection with the meat packing class was due to work related accidents, but was so frequent that it came to symbolically represent the sub class. It seems as though this is a part of the Japanese history that some groups within Japan would like to see forgotten. Therefore, it is at great risk that you publish four fingered characters in Japan, as you may very likely end up in legal battles with a vociferous pressure group. This group claims that this type of representation is equivalent to and as degrading as the yellow star forced to be worn on Jews by the Nazis during the Second World War. That is, it’s offensive and degrading unless they can extort enough money out of you. Then it’s all okay. Case in point: We were told that the Walt Disney Corporation is charged five million dollars a year by this group so that Mickey Mouse may live in Japan and retain his original four fingered design. Otherwise, old Mickey would need to see a surgeon and have something done about that insulting forth finger.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The moral of this story is… if you want to pay, then it’s okay. If you don’t want to pay, then it’s a horrible insult to our culture. In other parts of the world we have a word for these types of two-faced tactics. We call it extortion. If it is truly offensive and degrading, then don’t allow it at all. But to allow it for a price… is to belittle the case altogether. It suggests that the real truth behind these groups is that they are using the darker moments in their own cultures’ history as an excuse to coerce money out of content providers.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Well, being that this is Oddworld, we felt that this seemed like a perfect addition to the Abe story. We thought it was ironically perfect that he was being discriminated against for being who he was. As the message came from Japan, “They don’t like his kind here,"? with the sincere suggestion, “Just chop off one of his fingers cause you don’t have the money to pay up…"? caused us to feel that we indeed needed to allow Abe to go through the suffering that goes along with being a poor slob at the bottom of the Food chain. Yup, we chopped off his finger so that the Japanese wouldn’t get offended (or paid). He didn’t like it one bit, but due to the fact that their ain’t much he can do about it… we decided that he could donate his finger rather than us donating five million dollars. Such is life in Japan when you’re a four-fingered meat packing worker.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">And that is how Abe lost his finger in Japan. He’s still pretty pissed off about it, but we convinced him that with the amount of games sold in Japan, he still might be able to get his message through to their culture someday. As a true believer in his cause, he felt that the sacrifice of a finger was but a small price to pay in hoping to shed some light on discriminations and injustices the world over.</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">Unfortunately, Stranger’s Wrath HD exceeds the 2GB limit on XBLA titles, and we’re unable to publish via Games on Demand because we haven’t published two disc products (Stranger and Munch were originally published by other companies). We have not given up and are in ongoing communication with Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>NEW GAMES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there ever be new Oddworld games?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes! Once Stranger’s Wrath HD and Munch’s Oddysee HD are complete, we will start production on two new titles, Oddworld: The Hand of Odd and something we’re calling Abe HD.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Looking further into the future we hope to return to other unreleased projects (SligStorm and The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot), including the long-awaited continuation of the Oddworld Quintology with Squeek’s Oddysee. It is far too early to start talking about these or any other future plans.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell me about Abe HD?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> News of Abe HD was let slip to the public a lot earlier than we were anticipating; we are not ready to start talking about it properly and we haven’t yet started production on it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It will be 2.5D: gameplay will be 2D, but graphics will be 3D. Gameplay will be smooth-scrolling, not screen-scrolling like Abe’s Oddysee. Cut-scenes will be rendered in realtime, not pre-rendered like Abe’s Oddysee. We haven’t decided whether to make Abe’s Oddysee, Abe’s Exoddus, something new, or a combination of the above. It will be released at the end of 2012 at the earliest. Platforms are not yet determined. It will not be part of the Oddboxx or a free update for existing Abe’s Oddysee and Abe’s Exoddus customers: this is an entirely new game engine constructed virtually from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell me about Hand of Odd?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Hand of Odd was originally conceived and announced in the 1990s as a relatively typical RTS game, and a hugely detailed 4-inch-thick design document already exists. We will be reworking the existing designs to suit the emergent social gaming environment.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">When we talk about taking inspiration from Zynga, we are talking about the ‘freemium’ business model, NOT their games. Hand of Odd will NOT be like FarmVille or CityVille. What we are saying is that it will be free to play, but there will be monetized elements. Beyond that, we can’t comment on gameplay, platforms or other details because they’re not set in stone. Hand of Odd will hopefully deliver in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will you make your next announcement?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> When we’re good and ready. Sit down and shaddap already!</p>
<p><strong>COMMENTS AND ALF</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Why hasn’t my comment been approved on Oddworld.com?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Alf handles most of the comments on Oddworld.com, and he can be a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to answering questions. You may have to wait until he’s happy with his answer before he approves your comment.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Alternatively, your question might be in line to appear in the next Dear Alf, or it might be a frequently asked question that Alf’s tired of answering.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who is Alf?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Alf is our liaison with the fans. He was introduced in Abe’s Exoddus as Abe’s friend who followed him through the desert. Alf went on to open Alf’s Rehab &amp; Tea, where Mudokons sick from SoulStorm Brew come seeking rehabilitation, and where Oddworld fans come seeking answers to their questions.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do Mudokons have four fingers on each hand in Abe’s Oddysee but only three in Abe’s Exoddus?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Well, it’s a long story that needs to be told. So here it is… Japan has a strict discriminating policy against any simulated characters entering their country with four fingers. Historically, Japan has had a subclass of meat packing workers that were typically looked down upon in their society. In later days, the blatant displaying of a four fingered hand gesture, intentionally directed at another, came to mean that you were calling them a member of the meat packing sub class. Which, we understand, was not at all a compliment.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It appears that the four finger connection with the meat packing class was due to work related accidents, but was so frequent that it came to symbolically represent the sub class. It seems as though this is a part of the Japanese history that some groups within Japan would like to see forgotten. Therefore, it is at great risk that you publish four fingered characters in Japan, as you may very likely end up in legal battles with a vociferous pressure group. This group claims that this type of representation is equivalent to and as degrading as the yellow star forced to be worn on Jews by the Nazis during the Second World War. That is, it’s offensive and degrading unless they can extort enough money out of you. Then it’s all okay. Case in point: We were told that the Walt Disney Corporation is charged five million dollars a year by this group so that Mickey Mouse may live in Japan and retain his original four fingered design. Otherwise, old Mickey would need to see a surgeon and have something done about that insulting forth finger.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The moral of this story is… if you want to pay, then it’s okay. If you don’t want to pay, then it’s a horrible insult to our culture. In other parts of the world we have a word for these types of two-faced tactics. We call it extortion. If it is truly offensive and degrading, then don’t allow it at all. But to allow it for a price… is to belittle the case altogether. It suggests that the real truth behind these groups is that they are using the darker moments in their own cultures’ history as an excuse to coerce money out of content providers.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Well, being that this is Oddworld, we felt that this seemed like a perfect addition to the Abe story. We thought it was ironically perfect that he was being discriminated against for being who he was. As the message came from Japan, “They don’t like his kind here,” with the sincere suggestion, “Just chop off one of his fingers cause you don’t have the money to pay up…” caused us to feel that we indeed needed to allow Abe to go through the suffering that goes along with being a poor slob at the bottom of the Food chain. Yup, we chopped off his finger so that the Japanese wouldn’t get offended (or paid). He didn’t like it one bit, but due to the fact that their ain’t much he can do about it… we decided that he could donate his finger rather than us donating five million dollars. Such is life in Japan when you’re a four-fingered meat packing worker.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">And that is how Abe lost his finger in Japan. He’s still pretty pissed off about it, but we convinced him that with the amount of games sold in Japan, he still might be able to get his message through to their culture someday. As a true believer in his cause, he felt that the sacrifice of a finger was but a small price to pay in hoping to shed some light on discriminations and injustices the world over.</p>

<p><strong>COMMENTS AND ALF</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Why hasn’t my comment been approved on Oddworld.com?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> All new users require to have their account manually approved for commenting - we aim to review all new users within 24 hours. Alternatively, your question might be in line to appear in the next Dear Alf, or it might be a frequently asked question that Alf’s tired of answering.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who is Alf?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Alf is our liaison with the fans. He was introduced in Abe’s Exoddus as Abe’s friend who followed him through the desert. Alf went on to open Alf’s Rehab &amp; Tea, where Mudokons sick from SoulStorm Brew come seeking rehabilitation, and where Oddworld fans come seeking answers to their questions.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you be releasing your games on Mac/Xbox 360/[insert platform here]?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We are a platform agnostic developer, no longer building games for any specific system, and we’ll always looks to bring out projects on multiple platforms. We have to be realistic and consider how easy it would be to do that, how well the game would play on that system, and how many sales we’d see from it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Unfortunately, Stranger’s Wrath HD exceeds the 2GB limit on XBLA titles, and we’re unable to publish via Games on Demand because we haven’t published two disc products (Stranger and Munch were originally published by other companies). We have not given up and are in ongoing communication with Microsoft.</p>

<p><strong>STRANGER'S WRATH</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: When trying to download Stranger’s Wrath I get the error message “This game is currently unavailable. Please try again another time.”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> You must download and install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package, either <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x86</a> if your system is 32-bit, or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=BD2A6171-E2D6-4230-B809-9A8D7548C1B6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x64</a> if your system is 64-bit. This will solve the problem, although you may have to reboot Steam or your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The graphics in Stranger’s Wrath are corrupted on my ATI graphics card.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately we are victim of bugs within ATI’s OpenGL drivers. To solve the problem of NPCs sticking in a ‘T-position’, download the latest drivers for your graphics card.

<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Disable any multi-threading options enabled in your Nvidia nView control panel.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I become unable to move Stranger in Stranger’s Wrath.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Make sure that you have ‘vsync’ enabled in the game’s launcher.</p>
<p><strong>NEW 'N' TASTY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty is a ground-up remake of 1997′s Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee. While it follows the same story as the original game, it has all-new graphics, all-new sound and all-new controls, while maintaining the same classic gameplay as before.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For more information, including screenshots and trailers, see our<a href="http://www.oddworld.com/oddworldgames/new-n-tasty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> New ‘n’ Tasty game page</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For even more insight, our news blog includes <a href="http://www.oddworld.com/category/dev-diary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer diaries</a>, <a href="http://www.oddworld.com/tag/ingredients/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Ingredients”</a> articles, and <a href="http://www.oddworld.com/tag/comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screenshot comparisons</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What platforms will New ‘n’ Tasty be released on?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty will be released on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox One, Windows, Mac and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there be a physical or retail release of New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Although we aren’t ruling out the possibility of a physical release in the future, we have no plans currently. The price of physical distribution runs into millions of dollars, and while that’s feasible for large publishers to pay and get enough sales to justify the expense, as a small, independent company we can’t afford to self-publish physically.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How much will New ‘n’ Tasty cost?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty will cost the equivalent of US $29.99 in the Americas, and £17.99/€20.99 in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia or New Zealand. We believe this is $30.25 in Australia, $34.95 in New Zealand.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">While we’ve seen some cautious or dismissive responses to our price being relatively high compared to other indie, download-only titles, we believe this is a fair reflection of the quality of game we have developed.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there be a collector’s edition of New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> No. Although we have looked into a collector’s edition, it is not something we have plans for.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty have QuikSave?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty will bring QuikSave (first introduced in Abe’s Exoddus) to the story of Abe’s escape from RuptureFarms. Additionally, you will be able to QuikLoad to your most recent QuikSave at any time. On the PlayStation 4, QuikSave and QuikLoad are as easy as a tap or hold of the DualShock 4 touch pad.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will Abe be able to say “All o’ya” in New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, Abe can speak to and lead multiple Mudokons at once using “All o’ya”. Abe will still be able to talk to Mudokons individually using his traditional “hello”.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will Abe be able to fart in New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Abe wouldn’t be Abe if he couldn’t fart.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will New ‘n’ Tasty be released on PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox One, Windows, Mac and Linux?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We’re working hard to get New ‘n’ Tasty looking and playing excellent on these platforms, but right now we don’t have release dates for them. We’ll announce release dates when we’re completely confident we know what those dates will be.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The only release dates we currently have are for New ‘n’ Tasty on PlayStation 4, which is released on July 22nd in the Americas, and on July 23rd in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty be Cross-Buy or Cross-Save?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty has both Cross-Buy and Cross-Save. If you buy New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store, you will be able to download it to your PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita consoles and play as soon as it is released on those platforms. Your save games will be shared across the PlayStation Network, so you could put down your DualShock controller and continue from where you left off on your PS Vita.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I have Cross-Buy if I buy on my PlayStation 4 or the Sony Entertainment Network website.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty is Cross-Buy regardless of which device you were using when you purchased New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I pre-order New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Pre-ordering for New ‘n’ Tasty on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita have now ended in the Americas.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">There will be no pre-ordering available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 or PlayStation Vita in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We hope to have pre-ordering available for Wii U, Xbox One, Windows, Mac and Linux, but we don’t have any details about it yet. We’ll announce pre-order details on these platforms when we know them.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will I be able to pre-load New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> If you are in the Americas, you can install and play New ‘n’ Tasty on your PlayStation 4 right away.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Pre-ordering is not available in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia or New Zealand, so in these regions you will have to buy and download New ‘n’ Tasty after it is released on the PlayStation Store on July 23rd.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I get the QuikBuy Bonus content?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The QuikBuy Bonuses (Alf’s Escape level and Scrub Abe costume) are available to fans who buy New ‘n’ Tasty early, but the details differ depending on where your PlayStation Network account is registered.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If your PlayStation Network account is registered in the Americas, you must have pre-ordered New ‘n’ Tasty before it was released for PlayStation 4 on July 22nd.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If your PlayStation Network account is registered in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia or New Zealand, you must have an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you purchase New ‘n’ Tasty within two weeks of the PlayStation 4 release date on July 23rd.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In either case, the Scrub Abe costume will be available to QuikBuyers when New ‘n’ Tasty releases on PlayStation 4; Alf’s Escape will be available to QuikBuyers for free as soon as it is released as DLC at a later date.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will the QuikBuy Bonuses be Cross-Buy?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, the QuikBuy Bonuses will be available to play on your PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita when the QuikBuy content is released for those platforms. Again, this is true regardless of which device you were using when you purchased New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When does my PlayStation Plus subscription have to be active for me to get the QuikBuy Bonuses?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> To get the Scrub Abe costume in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand, you must have an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you purchase New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store within two weeks of the PlayStation 4 release date on July 23rd.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Do I need to have an active PlayStation Plus subscription when I download the QuikBuy Bonuses?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> In order to get the Scrub Abe costume in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand, you must have an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you purchase New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store within two weeks of the PlayStation 4 release date on July 23rd.

<p><strong>Q: Can I get the QuikBuy Bonuses if my PlayStation Plus subscription is a free trial?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, a free trial of PlayStation Plus is sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I be able to get the QuikBuy Bonuses if I do not QuikBuy New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> You will be able to purchase the Alf’s Escape level separately as DLC when it is released on the PlayStation Store some time after New ‘n’ Tasty is released. The Scrub Abe costume is exclusive to QuikBuying New ‘n’ Tasty.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will the Alf’s Escape DLC be released?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We currently do not have a release date for Alf’s Escape on any platform.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I get the QuikBuy Bonus content on other platforms?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We will make the QuikBuy Bonus content available on all platforms in one way or another, but at this time we do not have any details for how it will be available on any of these platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What languages is New ‘n’ Tasty available in?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> When New ‘n’ Tasty launches on the PlayStation 4 it will have full text translations, including subtitles for movies, in the following languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese and Turkish. We hope to add voice translations in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the PC requirements for New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> At this time we cannot confirm the system requirements for New ‘n’ Tasty on PC platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty be as difficult as the original Abe’s Oddysee?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty comes with three difficulty modes. Easy and Medium difficulties introduce a health system similar to the one from Munch’s Oddysee: Abe has a number of birds that represent his health, and when he takes damage, birds will fly out from him. He can replenish his health by rescuing Mudokons or spotting health birds out in the wild, but some dangers will still be one-hit kills, like bombs and meat grinders.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">This means that many more people can now experience the full story of New ‘n’ Tasty like we think they should, but we haven’t forgotten the challenge-seekers amongst you! The Hard difficulty level will have one-hit kills throughout, and you’ll need to complete New ‘n’ Tasty in Hard to get all the PlayStation trophies.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Players looking for an ongoing challenge can compete for the fastest times on New ‘n’ Tasty’s online leaderboards.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How long is New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty is the same complete game as Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee, so the answer will be different depending on how familiar you are with the original, as well as the difficulty level you’re playing on and how determined you are to find all the secrets. We estimate a new player will be playing for 8 to 12 hours if they’re trying to rescue every Mudokon.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">However, we fully expect that speedrunners will annihilate that time, and we’ve even included online leaderboards so you can compete for the fastest playthroughs with your friends and other Oddworld fans worldwide. There’s even a trophy for beating our developers’ best times.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does New ‘n’ Tasty have a platinum trophy?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty has a platinum trophy on PlayStation platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty have a single trophy list across all PlayStation platforms, or separate trophy lists for each PlayStation platform?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty has a single trophy list shared by all three PlayStation platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We were getting a lot of conflicting fan opinions on whether we should do that or let players earn three sets of trophies (including platinum trophies), so we ran a poll on Oddworld.com. The results were 2:1 in favor of that single, shared list, so that’s what we’re going with.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty have 3DTV support?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty will not have support for 3DTV when it is released. We may consider adding it at a later date.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I be able to change my controller layout to the Abe’s Oddysee layout?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> You won’t be able to change the controller layout for New ‘n’ Tasty on consoles (although you will of course be free to rebind controls on PC), but we’ve focused on creating a single control scheme that is suited to the expectations of modern players. For example, you can now use the analog sticks to control Abe’s movement and throwing with much more precision.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will the music/speech/sounds in New ‘n’ Tasty be the same as in Abe’s Oddysee?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> All of the audio in New ‘n’ Tasty, including voices, sound effects and music, has been rerecorded at the high quality expected of modern games. The soundtrack has been recreated accurately, so you will not miss the classic music you remember from Abe’s Oddysee.</p>
<p><strong>ODDBOXX</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is Oddboxx?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The Oddworld Oddbox is a compilation of the first four Oddworld games, available on PC and now PlayStation 3. It contains Abe's Oddysee, Abe's Exoddus, Munch's Oddysee and Stranger's Wrath, with HD versions replacing the originals as appropriate. It's available only as a digital download bundle. Read all about it <a href="http://www.oddworld.com/2013/11/what-is-oddboxx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I still buy the Oddbox if Munch’s Oddysee HD isn’t currently available in my country?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will any of the games play on PlayStation 4?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> No, the Oddboxx is not currently available for PlayStation 4.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Which languages will I get for Abe’s Oddysee, Abe’s Exoddus and Stranger’s Wrath HD?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> You should get the appropriate language for your territory.</p>
<p><strong>Q: My Oddboxx game still isn’t working on PC, can you help me?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Make sure you meet the minimum system requirements for running the game in question, and ensure you read the support text that has been posted on the Steam forums. If you’re still experiencing technical problems, email tech support with a good description of your troubles and details of your computer specs.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER GAMES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there ever be new Oddworld games?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes! Looking into the future we hope to return to other unreleased projects (SligStorm and The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot), including the long-awaited continuation of the Oddworld Quintology with Squeek’s Oddysee. It is far too early to start talking about these or any other future plans.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell me about Abe HD?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Abe HD is now Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty - you can read about it<a href="http://www.oddworld.com/oddworldgames/new-n-tasty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell me about Hand of Odd?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Hand of Odd was originally conceived and announced in the 1990s as a relatively typical RTS game, and a hugely detailed 4-inch-thick design document already exists. We will be reworking the existing designs to suit the emergent social gaming environment. When we talk about taking inspiration from Zynga, we are talking about the ‘freemium’ business model, NOT their games. Hand of Odd will NOT be like FarmVille or CityVille. What we are saying is that it will be free to play, but there will be monetized elements. Beyond that, we can’t comment on gameplay, platforms or other details because they’re not set in stone. Hand of Odd will hopefully deliver in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>COMMENTS AND ALF</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Why hasn’t my comment been approved on Oddworld.com?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> All new users require to have their account manually approved for commenting - we aim to review all new users within 24 hours. Alternatively, your question might be in line to appear in the next Dear Alf, or it might be a frequently asked question that Alf’s tired of answering.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who is Alf?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Alf is our liaison with the fans. He was introduced in Abe’s Exoddus as Abe’s friend who followed him through the desert. Alf went on to open Alf’s Rehab &amp; Tea, where Mudokons sick from SoulStorm Brew come seeking rehabilitation, and where Oddworld fans come seeking answers to their questions.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you be releasing your games on Mac/Xbox 360/[insert platform here]?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We are a platform agnostic developer, no longer building games for any specific system, and we’ll always looks to bring out projects on multiple platforms. We have to be realistic and consider how easy it would be to do that, how well the game would play on that system, and how many sales we’d see from it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Unfortunately, Stranger’s Wrath HD exceeds the 2GB limit on XBLA titles, and we’re unable to publish via Games on Demand because we haven’t published two disc products (Stranger and Munch were originally published by other companies). We have not given up and are in ongoing communication with Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do Mudokons have four fingers on each hand in Abe’s Oddysee but only three in Abe’s Exoddus?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Well, it’s a long story that needs to be told. So here it is… Japan has a strict discriminating policy against any simulated characters entering their country with four fingers. Historically, Japan has had a subclass of meat packing workers that were typically looked down upon in their society. In later days, the blatant displaying of a four fingered hand gesture, intentionally directed at another, came to mean that you were calling them a member of the meat packing sub class. Which, we understand, was not at all a compliment.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It appears that the four finger connection with the meat packing class was due to work related accidents, but was so frequent that it came to symbolically represent the sub class. It seems as though this is a part of the Japanese history that some groups within Japan would like to see forgotten. Therefore, it is at great risk that you publish four fingered characters in Japan, as you may very likely end up in legal battles with a vociferous pressure group. This group claims that this type of representation is equivalent to and as degrading as the yellow star forced to be worn on Jews by the Nazis during the Second World War. That is, it’s offensive and degrading unless they can extort enough money out of you. Then it’s all okay. Case in point: We were told that the Walt Disney Corporation is charged five million dollars a year by this group so that Mickey Mouse may live in Japan and retain his original four fingered design. Otherwise, old Mickey would need to see a surgeon and have something done about that insulting forth finger.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The moral of this story is… if you want to pay, then it’s okay. If you don’t want to pay, then it’s a horrible insult to our culture. In other parts of the world we have a word for these types of two-faced tactics. We call it extortion. If it is truly offensive and degrading, then don’t allow it at all. But to allow it for a price… is to belittle the case altogether. It suggests that the real truth behind these groups is that they are using the darker moments in their own cultures’ history as an excuse to coerce money out of content providers.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Well, being that this is Oddworld, we felt that this seemed like a perfect addition to the Abe story. We thought it was ironically perfect that he was being discriminated against for being who he was. As the message came from Japan, “They don’t like his kind here,” with the sincere suggestion, “Just chop off one of his fingers cause you don’t have the money to pay up…” caused us to feel that we indeed needed to allow Abe to go through the suffering that goes along with being a poor slob at the bottom of the Food chain. Yup, we chopped off his finger so that the Japanese wouldn’t get offended (or paid). He didn’t like it one bit, but due to the fact that their ain’t much he can do about it… we decided that he could donate his finger rather than us donating five million dollars. Such is life in Japan when you’re a four-fingered meat packing worker.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">And that is how Abe lost his finger in Japan. He’s still pretty pissed off about it, but we convinced him that with the amount of games sold in Japan, he still might be able to get his message through to their culture someday. As a true believer in his cause, he felt that the sacrifice of a finger was but a small price to pay in hoping to shed some light on discriminations and injustices the world over.</p>

<p><strong>STRANGER'S WRATH</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: When trying to download Stranger’s Wrath I get the error message “This game is currently unavailable. Please try again another time.”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> You must download and install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package, either <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x86</a> if your system is 32-bit, or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=BD2A6171-E2D6-4230-B809-9A8D7548C1B6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x64</a> if your system is 64-bit. This will solve the problem, although you may have to reboot Steam or your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The graphics in Stranger’s Wrath are corrupted on my ATI graphics card.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately we are victim of bugs within ATI’s OpenGL drivers. To solve the problem of NPCs sticking in a ‘T-position’, download the latest drivers for your graphics card. ATI’s engineers are working on the other bugs now and they will release updated drivers that will fix other graphical glitches in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Stranger’s Wrath game crashes on the loading screen on my Nvidia graphics board.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Disable any multi-threading options enabled in your Nvidia nView control panel.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I become unable to move Stranger in Stranger’s Wrath.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Make sure that you have ‘vsync’ enabled in the game’s launcher.</p>
<p><strong>NEW 'N' TASTY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty is a ground-up remake of 1997’s Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee. While it follows the same story as the original game, it has all-new graphics, all-new sound and all-new controls, while maintaining the same classic gameplay as before.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For more information, including screenshots and trailers, see our New ‘n’ Tasty game page.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For even more insight, our news blog includes developer diaries, “Ingredients” articles, and screenshot comparisons.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What platforms will New ‘n’ Tasty be released on?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty has already been released on PlayStation 4, and in the future it will be released on PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox One, Windows, Mac and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there be a physical or retail release of New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Although we aren’t ruling out the possibility of a physical release in the future, we have no plans currently. The price of physical distribution runs into millions of dollars, and while that’s feasible for large publishers to pay and get enough sales to justify the expense, as a small, independent company we can’t afford to self-publish physically.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How much does New ‘n’ Tasty cost?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty costs the equivalent of US $29.99 in the Americas, and £17.99/€20.99 in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia or New Zealand. We believe this is $30.25 in Australia, $34.95 in New Zealand.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">While we’ve seen some cautious or dismissive responses to our price being relatively high compared to other indie, download-only titles, we believe this is a fair reflection of the quality of game we have developed.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there be a collector’s edition of New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> No. Although we have considered a collector’s edition, it is not something we have plans for.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does New ‘n’ Tasty have QuikSave?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty brings QuikSave (first introduced in Abe’s Exoddus) to the story of Abe’s escape from RuptureFarms. Additionally, you can QuikLoad to your most recent QuikSave at any time. On the PlayStation 4, QuikSave and QuikLoad are as easy as a tap or hold of the DualShock 4 touch pad.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can Abe say “All o’ya” in New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, Abe can speak to and lead multiple Mudokons at once using “All o’ya”. Abe will still be able to talk to Mudokons individually using his traditional “hello”.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can Abe fart in New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Of course! Abe wouldn’t be Abe if he couldn’t fart.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will New ‘n’ Tasty be released on PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox One, Windows, Mac and Linux?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We’re working hard to get New ‘n’ Tasty looking and playing excellent on these platforms, but right now we don’t know the release dates for them. We’ll announce release dates when we’re completely confident we know what those dates will be.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty be Cross-Buy or Cross-Save?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty has both Cross-Buy and Cross-Save. If you buy New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store, you will be able to download it to your PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita consoles and play as soon as it is released on those platforms. Your save games will be shared across the PlayStation Network, so you could put down your DualShock 4 controller and continue from where you left off on your PS Vita.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I have Cross-Buy if I buy on my PlayStation 4 or the Sony Entertainment Network website.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty is Cross-Buy regardless of which device you were using when you purchased New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I pre-order New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Pre-ordering for New ‘n’ Tasty on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita has now ended in the Americas.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">There will be no pre-ordering available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 or PlayStation Vita in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We hope to have pre-ordering available for Wii U, Xbox One, Windows, Mac and Linux, but we don’t have any details about it yet. We’ll announce pre-order details on these platforms when we know them.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I get the QuikBuy Bonus content?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The QuikBuy Bonuses (Alf’s Escape level and Scrub Abe costume) are available to fans who buy New ‘n’ Tasty early, but the details differ depending on where your PlayStation Network account is registered.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If your PlayStation Network account is registered in the Americas, you must have pre-ordered New ‘n’ Tasty before it was released for PlayStation 4 on July 22nd. Anyone who pre-ordered has Alf’s Escape and Scrub Abe for free.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If your PlayStation Network account is registered in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia or New Zealand, you must have had an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you purchased New ‘n’ Tasty within two weeks of the PlayStation 4 release date on July 23rd to get the Scrub Abe costume.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In the same regions, Alf’s Escape is free to all PlayStation Plus subscribers for two weeks of its PlayStation 4 release date on August 20th.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will the QuikBuy Bonuses be Cross-Buy?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, the QuikBuy Bonuses will be available to play on your PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita when the QuikBuy content is released for those platforms. Again, this is true regardless of which device you were using when you purchased New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When does my PlayStation Plus subscription have to be active for me to get the QuikBuy Bonuses?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> To get the Scrub Abe costume in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand, you must have had an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you purchase New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store within two weeks of the PlayStation 4 release date on July 23rd. Because these two weeks have ended, you can no longer get the Scrub Abe costume.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">To get the Alf’s Escape DLC level for free in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand, you must have an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you download Alf’s Escape from the PlayStation Store within two weeks of the DLC being released for PlayStation 4 on August 20th.</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">In order to get Alf’s Escape for free in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand, you must have an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you add Alf’s Escape to your PlayStation Network account within two weeks of the DLC releasing. This will permanently add Alf’s Escape to your PlayStation Network account, which you can then download at any time after it is released.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I get the QuikBuy Bonuses if my PlayStation Plus subscription is a free trial?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, a free trial of PlayStation Plus is enough to get the QuikBuy Bonuses.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I be able to get the QuikBuy Bonuses if I did not QuikBuy New ‘n’ Tasty or Alf’s Escape?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The Scrub Abe costume is exclusive to QuikBuying New ‘n’ Tasty, and cannot be purchased separately.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If you did not QuikBuy New ‘n’ Tasty or Alf’s Escape, you can purchase Alf’s Escape separately on the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I get the QuikBuy Bonus content on other platforms?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We will make the QuikBuy Bonus content (Scrub Abe costume and Alf’s Escape DLC level) available on all platforms in one way or another, but at this time we do not have any details on how it will be available for any of these platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What languages is New ‘n’ Tasty available in?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty has full text translations, including subtitles for movies, in the following languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese and Turkish. We hope to add voice translations in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the PC requirements for New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> At this time we cannot confirm the system requirements for New ‘n’ Tasty on PC platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is New ‘n’ Tasty be as difficult as the original Abe’s Oddysee?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty comes with three difficulty modes. Easy and Medium difficulties introduce a health system similar to the one from Munch’s Oddysee: Abe has a number of birds that represent his health, and when he takes damage, birds will fly out from him. He can replenish his health by rescuing Mudokons or spotting health birds out in the wild, but some dangers will still be one-hit kills, like bombs and meat grinders.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">This means that many more people can now experience the full story of New ‘n’ Tasty like we think they should, but we haven’t forgotten the challenge-seekers amongst you! The Hard difficulty level will have one-hit kills throughout, and you’ll need to complete New ‘n’ Tasty in Hard to get all the PlayStation trophies. Hard mode still comes with QuikSave, but you’re under no obligation to use it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For an even harder challenge, Alf’s Escape is a DLC level designed to stretch your advanced control skills to their limit. And players looking for an ongoing challenge can compete for the fastest times on New ‘n’ Tasty’s online leaderboards.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How long is New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty is the same complete game as Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee, so the answer will be different depending on how familiar you are with the original, as well as the difficulty level you’re playing on and how determined you are to find all the secrets. We estimate a new player will be playing for 8 to 12 hours if they’re trying to rescue every Mudokon.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">However, we fully expect that speedrunners will annihilate that time, and we’ve included online leaderboards so you can compete for the fastest playthroughs with your friends and other Oddworld fans worldwide. There’s even a trophy for beating our developers’ best times.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does New ‘n’ Tasty have a platinum trophy?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty has a platinum trophy on PlayStation platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty have a single trophy list across all PlayStation platforms, or separate trophy lists for each PlayStation platform?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty has a single trophy list shared by all three PlayStation platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We were getting a lot of conflicting opinions on whether we should do that or let players earn three sets of trophies (including platinum trophies), so we ran a poll on Oddworld.com. The results were 2:1 in favor of that single, shared list, so that’s what we’re going with.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty have 3DTV support?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty does not have any 3DTV support.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I be able to change my controller layout to the Abe’s Oddysee layout?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Currently you can’t change the controller layout for New ‘n’ Tasty on consoles (although you will of course be free to rebind controls on PC). We focused on creating a single control scheme that is best suited to the expectations of modern players. For example, you can now use the analog sticks to control Abe’s movement and throwing with much more precision than in Abe’s Oddysee.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">However, following a lot of feedback from our fans, we are currently considering modifications to our control scheme that will hopefully appeal to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are the music/speech/sounds in New ‘n’ Tasty the same as in Abe’s Oddysee?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> All of the audio in New ‘n’ Tasty, including voices, sound effects and music, has been rerecorded at the high quality expected of modern games. The soundtrack has been recreated accurately, so you will not miss the classic music you remember from Abe’s Oddysee. Abe’s voice is still provided by Lorne Lanning.</p>
<p><strong>ODDBOXX</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is Oddboxx?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The Oddworld Oddbox is a compilation of the first four Oddworld games, available on PC and now PlayStation 3. It contains Abe's Oddysee, Abe's Exoddus, Munch's Oddysee and Stranger's Wrath, with HD versions replacing the originals as appropriate. It's available only as a digital download bundle. Read all about it here.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I still buy the Oddbox if Munch’s Oddysee HD isn’t currently available in my country?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will any of the games play on PlayStation 4?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> No, the Oddboxx is not currently available for PlayStation 4.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Which languages will I get for Abe’s Oddysee, Abe’s Exoddus and Stranger’s Wrath HD?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> You should get the appropriate language for your territory.</p>
<p><strong>Q: My Oddboxx game still isn’t working on PC, can you help me?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Make sure you meet the minimum system requirements for running the game in question, and ensure you read the support text that has been posted on the Steam forums. If you’re still experiencing technical problems, email tech support with a good description of your troubles and details of your computer specs.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER GAMES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there ever be new Oddworld games?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes! Looking into the future we hope to return to other unreleased projects (SligStorm and The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot), including the long-awaited continuation of the Oddworld Quintology with Squeek’s Oddysee. It is far too early to start talking about these or any other future plans.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell me about Abe HD?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Abe HD is now Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty - you can read about it here.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell me about Hand of Odd?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Hand of Odd was originally conceived and announced in the 1990s as a relatively typical RTS game, and a hugely detailed 4-inch-thick design document already exists. We will be reworking the existing designs to suit the emergent social gaming environment. When we talk about taking inspiration from Zynga, we are talking about the ‘freemium’ business model, NOT their games. Hand of Odd will NOT be like FarmVille or CityVille. What we are saying is that it will be free to play, but there will be monetized elements. Beyond that, we can’t comment on gameplay, platforms or other details because they’re not set in stone. Hand of Odd will hopefully deliver in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>COMMENTS AND ALF</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Why hasn’t my comment been approved on Oddworld.com?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> All new users require to have their account manually approved for commenting - we aim to review all new users within 24 hours. Alternatively, your question might be in line to appear in the next Dear Alf, or it might be a frequently asked question that Alf’s tired of answering.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who is Alf?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Alf is our liaison with the fans. He was introduced in Abe’s Exoddus as Abe’s friend who followed him through the desert. Alf went on to open Alf’s Rehab &amp; Tea, where Mudokons sick from SoulStorm Brew come seeking rehabilitation, and where Oddworld fans come seeking answers to their questions.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you be releasing your games on Mac/Xbox 360/[insert platform here]?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We are a platform agnostic developer, no longer building games for any specific system, and we’ll always looks to bring out projects on multiple platforms. We have to be realistic and consider how easy it would be to do that, how well the game would play on that system, and how many sales we’d see from it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Unfortunately, Stranger’s Wrath HD exceeds the 2GB limit on XBLA titles, and we’re unable to publish via Games on Demand because we haven’t published two disc products (Stranger and Munch were originally published by other companies). We have not given up and are in ongoing communication with Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do Mudokons have four fingers on each hand in Abe’s Oddysee but only three in Abe’s Exoddus?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Well, it’s a long story that needs to be told. So here it is… Japan has a strict discriminating policy against any simulated characters entering their country with four fingers. Historically, Japan has had a subclass of meat packing workers that were typically looked down upon in their society. In later days, the blatant displaying of a four fingered hand gesture, intentionally directed at another, came to mean that you were calling them a member of the meat packing sub class. Which, we understand, was not at all a compliment.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It appears that the four finger connection with the meat packing class was due to work related accidents, but was so frequent that it came to symbolically represent the sub class. It seems as though this is a part of the Japanese history that some groups within Japan would like to see forgotten. Therefore, it is at great risk that you publish four fingered characters in Japan, as you may very likely end up in legal battles with a vociferous pressure group. This group claims that this type of representation is equivalent to and as degrading as the yellow star forced to be worn on Jews by the Nazis during the Second World War. That is, it’s offensive and degrading unless they can extort enough money out of you. Then it’s all okay. Case in point: We were told that the Walt Disney Corporation is charged five million dollars a year by this group so that Mickey Mouse may live in Japan and retain his original four fingered design. Otherwise, old Mickey would need to see a surgeon and have something done about that insulting forth finger.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The moral of this story is… if you want to pay, then it’s okay. If you don’t want to pay, then it’s a horrible insult to our culture. In other parts of the world we have a word for these types of two-faced tactics. We call it extortion. If it is truly offensive and degrading, then don’t allow it at all. But to allow it for a price… is to belittle the case altogether. It suggests that the real truth behind these groups is that they are using the darker moments in their own cultures’ history as an excuse to coerce money out of content providers.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Well, being that this is Oddworld, we felt that this seemed like a perfect addition to the Abe story. We thought it was ironically perfect that he was being discriminated against for being who he was. As the message came from Japan, “They don’t like his kind here,” with the sincere suggestion, “Just chop off one of his fingers cause you don’t have the money to pay up…” caused us to feel that we indeed needed to allow Abe to go through the suffering that goes along with being a poor slob at the bottom of the Food chain. Yup, we chopped off his finger so that the Japanese wouldn’t get offended (or paid). He didn’t like it one bit, but due to the fact that their ain’t much he can do about it… we decided that he could donate his finger rather than us donating five million dollars. Such is life in Japan when you’re a four-fingered meat packing worker.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">And that is how Abe lost his finger in Japan. He’s still pretty pissed off about it, but we convinced him that with the amount of games sold in Japan, he still might be able to get his message through to their culture someday. As a true believer in his cause, he felt that the sacrifice of a finger was but a small price to pay in hoping to shed some light on discriminations and injustices the world over.</p>

<p><strong>STRANGER'S WRATH</strong></p>
<p><em>Stranger’s Wrath (Mobile):</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: Which iOS devices will Stranger’s Wrath for mobile run on?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Oddworld Stranger’s Wrath requires at least an iPhone 4S, iPad 2, iPad Mini or iPod Touch 5th gen.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will the game be out for Android?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Very soon.</p>
<p><strong>Q: On iOS I lose some sound effects after about half-way through the game.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> This has been fixed and an update should be available from the App Store any moment now. As a workaround, save the game and reload your progress and it should fix the issues.</p>
<p><strong>Q: There’s one room in the game that causes a crash when I walk through it.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We are fixing this bug now, and will supply an update ASAP. As a workaround, load the save game with the issue, pause and select ‘load’, select the same save and load it, and you should be able to make it through the section.</p>
<p><em>Stranger’s Wrath (PC):</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: When trying to download Stranger’s Wrath on PC I get the error message “This game is currently unavailable. Please try again another time.”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> You must download and install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package, either x86 if your system is 32-bit, orx64 if your system is 64-bit. This will solve the problem, although you may have to reboot Steam or your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The graphics in Stranger’s Wrath on PC are corrupted on my ATI graphics card.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately we are victim of bugs within ATI’s OpenGL drivers. To solve the problem of NPCs sticking in a ‘T-position’, download the latest drivers for your graphics card. ATI’s engineers are working on the other bugs now and they will release updated drivers that will fix other graphical glitches in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Stranger’s Wrath on PC crashes on the loading screen on my Nvidia graphics board.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Disable any multi-threading options enabled in your Nvidia nView control panel.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I become unable to move Stranger in Stranger’s Wrath on PC.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Make sure that you have ‘vsync’ enabled in the game’s launcher.</p>
<p><strong>NEW 'N' TASTY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty is a ground-up remake of 1997’s Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee. While it follows the same story as the original game, it has all-new graphics, all-new sound and all-new controls, while maintaining the same classic gameplay as before.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For more information, including screenshots and trailers, see our New ‘n’ Tasty game page.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For even more insight, our news blog includes developer diaries, “Ingredients” articles, and screenshot comparisons.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What platforms will New ‘n’ Tasty be released on?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty has already been released on PlayStation 4, and in the future it will be released on PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox One, Windows, Mac and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there be a physical or retail release of New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Although we aren’t ruling out the possibility of a physical release in the future, we have no plans currently. The price of physical distribution runs into millions of dollars, and while that’s feasible for large publishers to pay and get enough sales to justify the expense, as a small, independent company we can’t afford to self-publish physically.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How much does New ‘n’ Tasty cost?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty costs the equivalent of US $29.99 in the Americas, and £17.99/€20.99 in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia or New Zealand. We believe this is $30.25 in Australia, $34.95 in New Zealand.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">While we’ve seen some cautious or dismissive responses to our price being relatively high compared to other indie, download-only titles, we believe this is a fair reflection of the quality of game we have developed.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there be a collector’s edition of New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> No. Although we have considered a collector’s edition, it is not something we have plans for.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does New ‘n’ Tasty have QuikSave?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty brings QuikSave (first introduced in Abe’s Exoddus) to the story of Abe’s escape from RuptureFarms. Additionally, you can QuikLoad to your most recent QuikSave at any time. On the PlayStation 4, QuikSave and QuikLoad are as easy as a tap or hold of the DualShock 4 touch pad.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can Abe say “All o’ya” in New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, Abe can speak to and lead multiple Mudokons at once using “All o’ya”. Abe will still be able to talk to Mudokons individually using his traditional “hello”.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can Abe fart in New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Of course! Abe wouldn’t be Abe if he couldn’t fart.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will New ‘n’ Tasty be released on PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox One, Windows, Mac and Linux?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We’re working hard to get New ‘n’ Tasty looking and playing excellent on these platforms, but right now we don’t know the release dates for them. We’ll announce release dates when we’re completely confident we know what those dates will be.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty be Cross-Buy or Cross-Save?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty has both Cross-Buy and Cross-Save. If you buy New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store, you will be able to download it to your PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita consoles and play as soon as it is released on those platforms. Your save games will be shared across the PlayStation Network, so you could put down your DualShock 4 controller and continue from where you left off on your PS Vita.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I have Cross-Buy if I buy on my PlayStation 4 or the Sony Entertainment Network website.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty is Cross-Buy regardless of which device you were using when you purchased New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I pre-order New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Pre-ordering for New ‘n’ Tasty on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita has now ended in the Americas.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">There will be no pre-ordering available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 or PlayStation Vita in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We hope to have pre-ordering available for Wii U, Xbox One, Windows, Mac and Linux, but we don’t have any details about it yet. We’ll announce pre-order details on these platforms when we know them.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I get the QuikBuy Bonus content?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The QuikBuy Bonuses (Alf’s Escape level and Scrub Abe costume) are available to fans who buy New ‘n’ Tasty early, but the details differ depending on where your PlayStation Network account is registered.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If your PlayStation Network account is registered in the Americas, you must have pre-ordered New ‘n’ Tasty before it was released for PlayStation 4 on July 22nd. Anyone who pre-ordered has Alf’s Escape and Scrub Abe for free.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If your PlayStation Network account is registered in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia or New Zealand, you must have had an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you purchased New ‘n’ Tasty within two weeks of the PlayStation 4 release date on July 23rd to get the Scrub Abe costume.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In the same regions, Alf’s Escape is free to all PlayStation Plus subscribers for two weeks of its PlayStation 4 release date on August 20th.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will the QuikBuy Bonuses be Cross-Buy?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, the QuikBuy Bonuses will be available to play on your PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita when the QuikBuy content is released for those platforms. Again, this is true regardless of which device you were using when you purchased New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When does my PlayStation Plus subscription have to be active for me to get the QuikBuy Bonuses?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> To get the Scrub Abe costume in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand, you must have had an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you purchase New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store within two weeks of the PlayStation 4 release date on July 23rd. Because these two weeks have ended, you can no longer get the Scrub Abe costume.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">To get the Alf’s Escape DLC level for free in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand, you must have an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you download Alf’s Escape from the PlayStation Store within two weeks of the DLC being released for PlayStation 4 on August 20th.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I need to have an active PlayStation Plus subscription when I download the QuikBuy Bonuses?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> In order to get the Scrub Abe costume in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand, you must have an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you purchase New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store within two weeks of the PlayStation 4 release date on July 23rd. This will permanently add the Scrub Abe costume to your PlayStation Network account, which you can then download at any time after it is released.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In order to get Alf’s Escape for free in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand, you must have an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you add Alf’s Escape to your PlayStation Network account within two weeks of the DLC releasing. This will permanently add Alf’s Escape to your PlayStation Network account, which you can then download at any time after it is released.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I get the QuikBuy Bonuses if my PlayStation Plus subscription is a free trial?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, a free trial of PlayStation Plus is enough to get the QuikBuy Bonuses.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I be able to get the QuikBuy Bonuses if I did not QuikBuy New ‘n’ Tasty or Alf’s Escape?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The Scrub Abe costume is exclusive to QuikBuying New ‘n’ Tasty, and cannot be purchased separately.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If you did not QuikBuy New ‘n’ Tasty or Alf’s Escape, you can purchase Alf’s Escape separately on the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I get the QuikBuy Bonus content on other platforms?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We will make the QuikBuy Bonus content (Scrub Abe costume and Alf’s Escape DLC level) available on all platforms in one way or another, but at this time we do not have any details on how it will be available for any of these platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What languages is New ‘n’ Tasty available in?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty has full text translations, including subtitles for movies, in the following languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese and Turkish. We hope to add voice translations in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the PC requirements for New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> At this time we cannot confirm the system requirements for New ‘n’ Tasty on PC platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is New ‘n’ Tasty be as difficult as the original Abe’s Oddysee?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty comes with three difficulty modes. Easy and Medium difficulties introduce a health system similar to the one from Munch’s Oddysee: Abe has a number of birds that represent his health, and when he takes damage, birds will fly out from him. He can replenish his health by rescuing Mudokons or spotting health birds out in the wild, but some dangers will still be one-hit kills, like bombs and meat grinders.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">This means that many more people can now experience the full story of New ‘n’ Tasty like we think they should, but we haven’t forgotten the challenge-seekers amongst you! The Hard difficulty level will have one-hit kills throughout, and you’ll need to complete New ‘n’ Tasty in Hard to get all the PlayStation trophies. Hard mode still comes with QuikSave, but you’re under no obligation to use it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For an even harder challenge, Alf’s Escape is a DLC level designed to stretch your advanced control skills to their limit. And players looking for an ongoing challenge can compete for the fastest times on New ‘n’ Tasty’s online leaderboards.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How long is New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty is the same complete game as Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee, so the answer will be different depending on how familiar you are with the original, as well as the difficulty level you’re playing on and how determined you are to find all the secrets. We estimate a new player will be playing for 8 to 12 hours if they’re trying to rescue every Mudokon.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">However, we fully expect that speedrunners will annihilate that time, and we’ve included online leaderboards so you can compete for the fastest playthroughs with your friends and other Oddworld fans worldwide. There’s even a trophy for beating our developers’ best times.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does New ‘n’ Tasty have a platinum trophy?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty has a platinum trophy on PlayStation platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty have a single trophy list across all PlayStation platforms, or separate trophy lists for each PlayStation platform?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty has a single trophy list shared by all three PlayStation platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We were getting a lot of conflicting opinions on whether we should do that or let players earn three sets of trophies (including platinum trophies), so we ran a poll on Oddworld.com. The results were 2:1 in favor of that single, shared list, so that’s what we’re going with.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty have 3DTV support?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty does not have any 3DTV support.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I be able to change my controller layout to the Abe’s Oddysee layout?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Currently you can’t change the controller layout for New ‘n’ Tasty on consoles (although you will of course be free to rebind controls on PC). We focused on creating a single control scheme that is best suited to the expectations of modern players. For example, you can now use the analog sticks to control Abe’s movement and throwing with much more precision than in Abe’s Oddysee.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">However, following a lot of feedback from our fans, we are currently considering modifications to our control scheme that will hopefully appeal to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are the music/speech/sounds in New ‘n’ Tasty the same as in Abe’s Oddysee?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> All of the audio in New ‘n’ Tasty, including voices, sound effects and music, has been rerecorded at the high quality expected of modern games. The soundtrack has been recreated accurately, so you will not miss the classic music you remember from Abe’s Oddysee. Abe’s voice is still provided by Lorne Lanning.</p>
<p><strong>ODDBOXX</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is Oddboxx?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The Oddworld Oddbox is a compilation of the first four Oddworld games, available on PC and now PlayStation 3. It contains Abe's Oddysee, Abe's Exoddus, Munch's Oddysee and Stranger's Wrath, with HD versions replacing the originals as appropriate. It's available only as a digital download bundle. Read all about it here.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I still buy the Oddbox if Munch’s Oddysee HD isn’t currently available in my country?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will any of the games play on PlayStation 4?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> No, the Oddboxx is not currently available for PlayStation 4.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Which languages will I get for Abe’s Oddysee, Abe’s Exoddus and Stranger’s Wrath HD?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> You should get the appropriate language for your territory.</p>
<p><strong>Q: My Oddboxx game still isn’t working on PC, can you help me?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Make sure you meet the minimum system requirements for running the game in question, and ensure you read the support text that has been posted on the Steam forums. If you’re still experiencing technical problems, email tech support with a good description of your troubles and details of your computer specs.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER GAMES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there ever be new Oddworld games?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes! Looking into the future we hope to return to other unreleased projects (SligStorm and The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot), including the long-awaited continuation of the Oddworld Quintology with Squeek’s Oddysee. It is far too early to start talking about these or any other future plans.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell me about Abe HD?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Abe HD is now Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty - you can read about it here.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell me about Hand of Odd?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Hand of Odd was originally conceived and announced in the 1990s as a relatively typical RTS game, and a hugely detailed 4-inch-thick design document already exists. We will be reworking the existing designs to suit the emergent social gaming environment. When we talk about taking inspiration from Zynga, we are talking about the ‘freemium’ business model, NOT their games. Hand of Odd will NOT be like FarmVille or CityVille. What we are saying is that it will be free to play, but there will be monetized elements. Beyond that, we can’t comment on gameplay, platforms or other details because they’re not set in stone. Hand of Odd will hopefully deliver in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>COMMENTS AND ALF</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Why hasn’t my comment been approved on Oddworld.com?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> All new users require to have their account manually approved for commenting - we aim to review all new users within 24 hours. Alternatively, your question might be in line to appear in the next Dear Alf, or it might be a frequently asked question that Alf’s tired of answering.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who is Alf?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Alf is our liaison with the fans. He was introduced in Abe’s Exoddus as Abe’s friend who followed him through the desert. Alf went on to open Alf’s Rehab &amp; Tea, where Mudokons sick from SoulStorm Brew come seeking rehabilitation, and where Oddworld fans come seeking answers to their questions.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you be releasing your games on Mac/Xbox 360/[insert platform here]?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We are a platform agnostic developer, no longer building games for any specific system, and we’ll always looks to bring out projects on multiple platforms. We have to be realistic and consider how easy it would be to do that, how well the game would play on that system, and how many sales we’d see from it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Unfortunately, Stranger’s Wrath HD exceeds the 2GB limit on XBLA titles, and we’re unable to publish via Games on Demand because we haven’t published two disc products (Stranger and Munch were originally published by other companies). We have not given up and are in ongoing communication with Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do Mudokons have four fingers on each hand in Abe’s Oddysee but only three in Abe’s Exoddus?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Well, it’s a long story that needs to be told. So here it is… Japan has a strict discriminating policy against any simulated characters entering their country with four fingers. Historically, Japan has had a subclass of meat packing workers that were typically looked down upon in their society. In later days, the blatant displaying of a four fingered hand gesture, intentionally directed at another, came to mean that you were calling them a member of the meat packing sub class. Which, we understand, was not at all a compliment.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It appears that the four finger connection with the meat packing class was due to work related accidents, but was so frequent that it came to symbolically represent the sub class. It seems as though this is a part of the Japanese history that some groups within Japan would like to see forgotten. Therefore, it is at great risk that you publish four fingered characters in Japan, as you may very likely end up in legal battles with a vociferous pressure group. This group claims that this type of representation is equivalent to and as degrading as the yellow star forced to be worn on Jews by the Nazis during the Second World War. That is, it’s offensive and degrading unless they can extort enough money out of you. Then it’s all okay. Case in point: We were told that the Walt Disney Corporation is charged five million dollars a year by this group so that Mickey Mouse may live in Japan and retain his original four fingered design. Otherwise, old Mickey would need to see a surgeon and have something done about that insulting forth finger.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The moral of this story is… if you want to pay, then it’s okay. If you don’t want to pay, then it’s a horrible insult to our culture. In other parts of the world we have a word for these types of two-faced tactics. We call it extortion. If it is truly offensive and degrading, then don’t allow it at all. But to allow it for a price… is to belittle the case altogether. It suggests that the real truth behind these groups is that they are using the darker moments in their own cultures’ history as an excuse to coerce money out of content providers.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Well, being that this is Oddworld, we felt that this seemed like a perfect addition to the Abe story. We thought it was ironically perfect that he was being discriminated against for being who he was. As the message came from Japan, “They don’t like his kind here,” with the sincere suggestion, “Just chop off one of his fingers cause you don’t have the money to pay up…” caused us to feel that we indeed needed to allow Abe to go through the suffering that goes along with being a poor slob at the bottom of the Food chain. Yup, we chopped off his finger so that the Japanese wouldn’t get offended (or paid). He didn’t like it one bit, but due to the fact that their ain’t much he can do about it… we decided that he could donate his finger rather than us donating five million dollars. Such is life in Japan when you’re a four-fingered meat packing worker.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">And that is how Abe lost his finger in Japan. He’s still pretty pissed off about it, but we convinced him that with the amount of games sold in Japan, he still might be able to get his message through to their culture someday. As a true believer in his cause, he felt that the sacrifice of a finger was but a small price to pay in hoping to shed some light on discriminations and injustices the world over.</p>

<p><strong>STRANGER'S WRATH</strong></p>
<p><em>Stranger’s Wrath (Mobile):</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: Where do I contact the developers for support?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Please email support@s1games.com.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Which iOS devices will Stranger’s Wrath for mobile run on?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Oddworld: Stranger’s Wrath requires at least an iPhone 4S, iPad 2, iPad Mini or iPod Touch 5th gen.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I play Stranger’s Wrath for mobile with a controller?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> You can! Stranger’s Wrath on iOS supports any MFi controller with a full profile, and on Android supports most HID controllers with a full profile. ‘Full profile’ refers to having enough inputs on the controller: two analog sticks, four directional button, four face buttons, two navigation buttons, and two shoulder buttons or triggers.</p>
<p><strong>Q: On iOS I lose some sound effects after about half-way through the game.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> This has been fixed and an update should be available from the App Store any moment now. As a workaround, save the game and reload your progress and it should fix the issues.</p>
<p><strong>Q: There’s one room in the game that causes a crash when I walk through it.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We are fixing this bug now, and will supply an update ASAP. As a workaround, load the save game with the issue, pause and select ‘load’, select the same save and load it, and you should be able to make it through the section.</p>
<p><em>Stranger’s Wrath (PC):</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: When trying to download Stranger’s Wrath on PC I get the error message “This game is currently unavailable. Please try again another time.”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> You must download and install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package, either x86 if your system is 32-bit, orx64 if your system is 64-bit. This will solve the problem, although you may have to reboot Steam or your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The graphics in Stranger’s Wrath on PC are corrupted on my ATI graphics card.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately we are victim of bugs within ATI’s OpenGL drivers. To solve the problem of NPCs sticking in a ‘T-position’, download the latest drivers for your graphics card. ATI’s engineers are working on the other bugs now and they will release updated drivers that will fix other graphical glitches in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Stranger’s Wrath on PC crashes on the loading screen on my Nvidia graphics board.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Disable any multi-threading options enabled in your Nvidia nView control panel.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I become unable to move Stranger in Stranger’s Wrath on PC.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Make sure that you have ‘vsync’ enabled in the game’s launcher.</p>
<p><strong>NEW 'N' TASTY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty is a ground-up remake of 1997’s Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee. While it follows the same story as the original game, it has all-new graphics, all-new sound and all-new controls, while maintaining the same classic gameplay as before.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For more information, including screenshots and trailers, see our New ‘n’ Tasty game page.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For even more insight, our news blog includes developer diaries, “Ingredients” articles, and screenshot comparisons.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What platforms will New ‘n’ Tasty be released on?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty has already been released on PlayStation 4, and in the future it will be released on PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox One, Windows, Mac and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there be a physical or retail release of New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Although we aren’t ruling out the possibility of a physical release in the future, we have no plans currently. The price of physical distribution runs into millions of dollars, and while that’s feasible for large publishers to pay and get enough sales to justify the expense, as a small, independent company we can’t afford to self-publish physically.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How much does New ‘n’ Tasty cost?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty costs the equivalent of US $29.99 in the Americas, and £17.99/€20.99 in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia or New Zealand. We believe this is $30.25 in Australia, $34.95 in New Zealand.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">While we’ve seen some cautious or dismissive responses to our price being relatively high compared to other indie, download-only titles, we believe this is a fair reflection of the quality of game we have developed.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there be a collector’s edition of New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> No. Although we have considered a collector’s edition, it is not something we have plans for.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does New ‘n’ Tasty have QuikSave?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty brings QuikSave (first introduced in Abe’s Exoddus) to the story of Abe’s escape from RuptureFarms. Additionally, you can QuikLoad to your most recent QuikSave at any time. On the PlayStation 4, QuikSave and QuikLoad are as easy as a tap or hold of the DualShock 4 touch pad.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can Abe say “All o’ya” in New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, Abe can speak to and lead multiple Mudokons at once using “All o’ya”. Abe will still be able to talk to Mudokons individually using his traditional “hello”.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can Abe fart in New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Of course! Abe wouldn’t be Abe if he couldn’t fart.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will New ‘n’ Tasty be released on PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox One, Windows, Mac and Linux?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We’re working hard to get New ‘n’ Tasty looking and playing excellent on these platforms, but right now we don’t know the release dates for them. We’ll announce release dates when we’re completely confident we know what those dates will be.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty be Cross-Buy or Cross-Save?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty has both Cross-Buy and Cross-Save. If you buy New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store, you will be able to download it to your PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita consoles and play as soon as it is released on those platforms. Your save games will be shared across the PlayStation Network, so you could put down your DualShock 4 controller and continue from where you left off on your PS Vita.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I have Cross-Buy if I buy on my PlayStation 4 or the Sony Entertainment Network website.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty is Cross-Buy regardless of which device you were using when you purchased New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I pre-order New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Pre-ordering for New ‘n’ Tasty on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita has now ended in the Americas.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">There will be no pre-ordering available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 or PlayStation Vita in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We hope to have pre-ordering available for Wii U, Xbox One, Windows, Mac and Linux, but we don’t have any details about it yet. We’ll announce pre-order details on these platforms when we know them.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I get the QuikBuy Bonus content?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The QuikBuy Bonuses (Alf’s Escape level and Scrub Abe costume) are available to fans who buy New ‘n’ Tasty early, but the details differ depending on where your PlayStation Network account is registered.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If your PlayStation Network account is registered in the Americas, you must have pre-ordered New ‘n’ Tasty before it was released for PlayStation 4 on July 22nd. Anyone who pre-ordered has Alf’s Escape and Scrub Abe for free.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If your PlayStation Network account is registered in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia or New Zealand, you must have had an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you purchased New ‘n’ Tasty within two weeks of the PlayStation 4 release date on July 23rd to get the Scrub Abe costume.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In the same regions, Alf’s Escape is free to all PlayStation Plus subscribers for two weeks of its PlayStation 4 release date on August 20th.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will the QuikBuy Bonuses be Cross-Buy?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, the QuikBuy Bonuses will be available to play on your PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita when the QuikBuy content is released for those platforms. Again, this is true regardless of which device you were using when you purchased New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When does my PlayStation Plus subscription have to be active for me to get the QuikBuy Bonuses?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> To get the Scrub Abe costume in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand, you must have had an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you purchase New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store within two weeks of the PlayStation 4 release date on July 23rd. Because these two weeks have ended, you can no longer get the Scrub Abe costume.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">To get the Alf’s Escape DLC level for free in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand, you must have an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you download Alf’s Escape from the PlayStation Store within two weeks of the DLC being released for PlayStation 4 on August 20th.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I need to have an active PlayStation Plus subscription when I download the QuikBuy Bonuses?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> In order to get the Scrub Abe costume in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand, you must have an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you purchase New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store within two weeks of the PlayStation 4 release date on July 23rd. This will permanently add the Scrub Abe costume to your PlayStation Network account, which you can then download at any time after it is released.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In order to get Alf’s Escape for free in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand, you must have an active PlayStation Plus subscription when you add Alf’s Escape to your PlayStation Network account within two weeks of the DLC releasing. This will permanently add Alf’s Escape to your PlayStation Network account, which you can then download at any time after it is released.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I get the QuikBuy Bonuses if my PlayStation Plus subscription is a free trial?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, a free trial of PlayStation Plus is enough to get the QuikBuy Bonuses.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I be able to get the QuikBuy Bonuses if I did not QuikBuy New ‘n’ Tasty or Alf’s Escape?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The Scrub Abe costume is exclusive to QuikBuying New ‘n’ Tasty, and cannot be purchased separately.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If you did not QuikBuy New ‘n’ Tasty or Alf’s Escape, you can purchase Alf’s Escape separately on the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I get the QuikBuy Bonus content on other platforms?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We will make the QuikBuy Bonus content (Scrub Abe costume and Alf’s Escape DLC level) available on all platforms in one way or another, but at this time we do not have any details on how it will be available for any of these platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What languages is New ‘n’ Tasty available in?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty has full text translations, including subtitles for movies, in the following languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese and Turkish. We hope to add voice translations in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the PC requirements for New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> At this time we cannot confirm the system requirements for New ‘n’ Tasty on PC platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is New ‘n’ Tasty be as difficult as the original Abe’s Oddysee?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty comes with three difficulty modes. Easy and Medium difficulties introduce a health system similar to the one from Munch’s Oddysee: Abe has a number of birds that represent his health, and when he takes damage, birds will fly out from him. He can replenish his health by rescuing Mudokons or spotting health birds out in the wild, but some dangers will still be one-hit kills, like bombs and meat grinders.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">This means that many more people can now experience the full story of New ‘n’ Tasty like we think they should, but we haven’t forgotten the challenge-seekers amongst you! The Hard difficulty level will have one-hit kills throughout, and you’ll need to complete New ‘n’ Tasty in Hard to get all the PlayStation trophies. Hard mode still comes with QuikSave, but you’re under no obligation to use it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For an even harder challenge, Alf’s Escape is a DLC level designed to stretch your advanced control skills to their limit. And players looking for an ongoing challenge can compete for the fastest times on New ‘n’ Tasty’s online leaderboards.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How long is New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty is the same complete game as Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee, so the answer will be different depending on how familiar you are with the original, as well as the difficulty level you’re playing on and how determined you are to find all the secrets. We estimate a new player will be playing for 8 to 12 hours if they’re trying to rescue every Mudokon.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">However, we fully expect that speedrunners will annihilate that time, and we’ve included online leaderboards so you can compete for the fastest playthroughs with your friends and other Oddworld fans worldwide. There’s even a trophy for beating our developers’ best times.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does New ‘n’ Tasty have a platinum trophy?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty has a platinum trophy on PlayStation platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty have a single trophy list across all PlayStation platforms, or separate trophy lists for each PlayStation platform?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty has a single trophy list shared by all three PlayStation platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We were getting a lot of conflicting opinions on whether we should do that or let players earn three sets of trophies (including platinum trophies), so we ran a poll on Oddworld.com. The results were 2:1 in favor of that single, shared list, so that’s what we’re going with.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty have 3DTV support?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty does not have any 3DTV support.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I be able to change my controller layout to the Abe’s Oddysee layout?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Currently you can’t change the controller layout for New ‘n’ Tasty on consoles (although you will of course be free to rebind controls on PC). We focused on creating a single control scheme that is best suited to the expectations of modern players. For example, you can now use the analog sticks to control Abe’s movement and throwing with much more precision than in Abe’s Oddysee.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">However, following a lot of feedback from our fans, we are currently considering modifications to our control scheme that will hopefully appeal to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are the music/speech/sounds in New ‘n’ Tasty the same as in Abe’s Oddysee?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> All of the audio in New ‘n’ Tasty, including voices, sound effects and music, has been rerecorded at the high quality expected of modern games. The soundtrack has been recreated accurately, so you will not miss the classic music you remember from Abe’s Oddysee. Abe’s voice is still provided by Lorne Lanning.</p>
<p><strong>ODDBOXX</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is Oddboxx?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The Oddworld Oddbox is a compilation of the first four Oddworld games, available on PC and now PlayStation 3. It contains Abe's Oddysee, Abe's Exoddus, Munch's Oddysee and Stranger's Wrath, with HD versions replacing the originals as appropriate. It's available only as a digital download bundle. Read all about it here.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I still buy the Oddbox if Munch’s Oddysee HD isn’t currently available in my country?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will any of the games play on PlayStation 4?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> No, the Oddboxx is not currently available for PlayStation 4.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Which languages will I get for Abe’s Oddysee, Abe’s Exoddus and Stranger’s Wrath HD?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> You should get the appropriate language for your territory.</p>
<p><strong>Q: My Oddboxx game still isn’t working on PC, can you help me?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Make sure you meet the minimum system requirements for running the game in question, and ensure you read the support text that has been posted on the Steam forums. If you’re still experiencing technical problems, email tech support with a good description of your troubles and details of your computer specs.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER GAMES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there ever be new Oddworld games?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes! Looking into the future we hope to return to other unreleased projects (SligStorm and The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot), including the long-awaited continuation of the Oddworld Quintology with Squeek’s Oddysee. It is far too early to start talking about these or any other future plans.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell me about Abe HD?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Abe HD is now Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty - you can read about it here.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell me about Hand of Odd?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Hand of Odd was originally conceived and announced in the 1990s as a relatively typical RTS game, and a hugely detailed 4-inch-thick design document already exists. We will be reworking the existing designs to suit the emergent social gaming environment. When we talk about taking inspiration from Zynga, we are talking about the ‘freemium’ business model, NOT their games. Hand of Odd will NOT be like FarmVille or CityVille. What we are saying is that it will be free to play, but there will be monetized elements. Beyond that, we can’t comment on gameplay, platforms or other details because they’re not set in stone. Hand of Odd will hopefully deliver in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>COMMENTS AND ALF</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Why hasn’t my comment been approved on Oddworld.com?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> All new users require to have their account manually approved for commenting - we aim to review all new users within 24 hours. Alternatively, your question might be in line to appear in the next Dear Alf, or it might be a frequently asked question that Alf’s tired of answering.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who is Alf?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Alf is our liaison with the fans. He was introduced in Abe’s Exoddus as Abe’s friend who followed him through the desert. Alf went on to open Alf’s Rehab &amp; Tea, where Mudokons sick from SoulStorm Brew come seeking rehabilitation, and where Oddworld fans come seeking answers to their questions.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you be releasing your games on Mac/Xbox 360/[insert platform here]?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We are a platform agnostic developer, no longer building games for any specific system, and we’ll always looks to bring out projects on multiple platforms. We have to be realistic and consider how easy it would be to do that, how well the game would play on that system, and how many sales we’d see from it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Unfortunately, Stranger’s Wrath HD exceeds the 2GB limit on XBLA titles, and we’re unable to publish via Games on Demand because we haven’t published two disc products (Stranger and Munch were originally published by other companies). We have not given up and are in ongoing communication with Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do Mudokons have four fingers on each hand in Abe’s Oddysee but only three in Abe’s Exoddus?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Well, it’s a long story that needs to be told. So here it is… Japan has a strict discriminating policy against any simulated characters entering their country with four fingers. Historically, Japan has had a subclass of meat packing workers that were typically looked down upon in their society. In later days, the blatant displaying of a four fingered hand gesture, intentionally directed at another, came to mean that you were calling them a member of the meat packing sub class. Which, we understand, was not at all a compliment.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It appears that the four finger connection with the meat packing class was due to work related accidents, but was so frequent that it came to symbolically represent the sub class. It seems as though this is a part of the Japanese history that some groups within Japan would like to see forgotten. Therefore, it is at great risk that you publish four fingered characters in Japan, as you may very likely end up in legal battles with a vociferous pressure group. This group claims that this type of representation is equivalent to and as degrading as the yellow star forced to be worn on Jews by the Nazis during the Second World War. That is, it’s offensive and degrading unless they can extort enough money out of you. Then it’s all okay. Case in point: We were told that the Walt Disney Corporation is charged five million dollars a year by this group so that Mickey Mouse may live in Japan and retain his original four fingered design. Otherwise, old Mickey would need to see a surgeon and have something done about that insulting forth finger.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The moral of this story is… if you want to pay, then it’s okay. If you don’t want to pay, then it’s a horrible insult to our culture. In other parts of the world we have a word for these types of two-faced tactics. We call it extortion. If it is truly offensive and degrading, then don’t allow it at all. But to allow it for a price… is to belittle the case altogether. It suggests that the real truth behind these groups is that they are using the darker moments in their own cultures’ history as an excuse to coerce money out of content providers.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Well, being that this is Oddworld, we felt that this seemed like a perfect addition to the Abe story. We thought it was ironically perfect that he was being discriminated against for being who he was. As the message came from Japan, “They don’t like his kind here,” with the sincere suggestion, “Just chop off one of his fingers cause you don’t have the money to pay up…” caused us to feel that we indeed needed to allow Abe to go through the suffering that goes along with being a poor slob at the bottom of the Food chain. Yup, we chopped off his finger so that the Japanese wouldn’t get offended (or paid). He didn’t like it one bit, but due to the fact that their ain’t much he can do about it… we decided that he could donate his finger rather than us donating five million dollars. Such is life in Japan when you’re a four-fingered meat packing worker.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">And that is how Abe lost his finger in Japan. He’s still pretty pissed off about it, but we convinced him that with the amount of games sold in Japan, he still might be able to get his message through to their culture someday. As a true believer in his cause, he felt that the sacrifice of a finger was but a small price to pay in hoping to shed some light on discriminations and injustices the world over.</p>

<p><strong>STRANGER'S WRATH</strong></p>
<p><em>Stranger’s Wrath (Mobile):</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: Where do I contact the developers for support?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Please email support@s1games.com.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Which iOS devices will Stranger’s Wrath for mobile run on?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Oddworld: Stranger’s Wrath requires at least an iPhone 4S, iPad 2, iPad Mini or iPod Touch 5th gen.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I play Stranger’s Wrath for mobile with a controller?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> You can! Stranger’s Wrath on iOS supports any MFi controller with a full profile, and on Android supports most HID controllers with a full profile. ‘Full profile’ refers to having enough inputs on the controller: two analog sticks, four directional button, four face buttons, two navigation buttons, and two shoulder buttons or triggers.</p>
<p><strong>Q: On iOS I lose some sound effects after about half-way through the game.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> This has been fixed and an update should be available from the App Store any moment now. As a workaround, save the game and reload your progress and it should fix the issues.</p>
<p><strong>Q: There’s one room in the game that causes a crash when I walk through it.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We are fixing this bug now, and will supply an update ASAP. As a workaround, load the save game with the issue, pause and select ‘load’, select the same save and load it, and you should be able to make it through the section.</p>
<p><em>Stranger’s Wrath (PC):</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: When trying to download Stranger’s Wrath on PC I get the error message “This game is currently unavailable. Please try again another time.”</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> You must download and install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package, either x86 if your system is 32-bit, orx64 if your system is 64-bit. This will solve the problem, although you may have to reboot Steam or your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The graphics in Stranger’s Wrath on PC are corrupted on my ATI graphics card.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately we are victim of bugs within ATI’s OpenGL drivers. To solve the problem of NPCs sticking in a ‘T-position’, download the latest drivers for your graphics card. ATI’s engineers are working on the other bugs now and they will release updated drivers that will fix other graphical glitches in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Stranger’s Wrath on PC crashes on the loading screen on my Nvidia graphics board.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Disable any multi-threading options enabled in your Nvidia nView control panel.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I become unable to move Stranger in Stranger’s Wrath on PC.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Make sure that you have ‘vsync’ enabled in the game’s launcher.</p>
<p><strong>NEW 'N' TASTY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty is a ground-up remake of 1997’s Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee. While it follows the same story as the original game, it has all-new graphics, all-new sound and all-new controls, while maintaining the same classic gameplay as before.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For more information, including screenshots and trailers, see our New ‘n’ Tasty game page.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What platforms will New ‘n’ Tasty be released on?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty has already been released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows, Mac and Linux (on Steam, GOG.com and Humble Store). In the future it will be released on PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and Wii U.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty be released on Android?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We have been experimenting with New ‘n’ Tasty on Android, but we haven’t committed to releasing on that platform.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there be a physical or retail release of New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Although we haven’t ruled out the possibility of a physical release in the future, we have no plans currently. The price of physical distribution runs into millions of dollars, and while that’s feasible for large publishers to pay and get enough sales to justify the expense, as a small, independent company we can’t afford to self-publish physically.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How much does New ‘n’ Tasty cost?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty costs the equivalent of between US $20.00 and US $29.99 depending on the platform you buy on. Visit the New ‘n’ Tasty game page for full information.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">While we’ve seen some cautious or dismissive responses to our price being relatively high compared to other indie, download-only titles, we believe this is a fair reflection of the quality of game we have developed.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there be a collector’s edition of New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> No. Although we have considered a collector’s edition, it is not something we have plans for.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does New ‘n’ Tasty have QuikSave?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty brings QuikSave (first introduced in Abe’s Exoddus) to the story of Abe’s escape from RuptureFarms. Additionally, you can QuikLoad to your most recent QuikSave at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can Abe say “All o’ya” in New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, Abe can speak to and lead multiple Mudokons at once using “All o’ya”. Abe will still be able to talk to Mudokons individually using his traditional “hello”.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can Abe fart in New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Of course! Abe wouldn’t be Abe if he couldn’t fart.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will New ‘n’ Tasty be released on PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and Wii U?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We’re working hard to get New ‘n’ Tasty looking and playing excellent on these platforms, but right now we don’t know the release dates for them. We’ll announce release dates when we’re completely confident we know what those dates will be.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty be Cross-Buy or Cross-Save?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, on PlayStation platforms New ‘n’ Tasty has both Cross-Buy and Cross-Save. If you buy New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store, you will be able to download it to your PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita consoles and play as soon as it is released on those platforms. Your save games will be shared across the PlayStation Network, so you could put down your DualShock 4 controller and continue from where you left off on your PS Vita.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Cross-Buy is also enabled for users who downloaded New ‘n’ Tasty for free from PlayStation Plus in March 2015. Both DLCs for New ‘n’ Tasty (Alf’s Escape and Scrub Abe) are also Cross-Buy.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I have Cross-Buy if I buy on my PlayStation 4 or the Sony Entertainment Network website.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty is Cross-Buy regardless of which device you were using when you purchased New ‘n’ Tasty from the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I pre-order New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Pre-ordering for New ‘n’ Tasty on PlayStation platforms has now ended in the Americas.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">There will be no pre-ordering available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 or PlayStation Vita in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Russia, Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We are looking into pre-ordering opportunities on remaining platforms but currently can’t confirm that it will be available.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What languages is New ‘n’ Tasty available in?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty has full text translations, including subtitles for movies, in the following languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese and Turkish. We hope to add voice translations in the future but cannot confirm that we will be able to.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the PC requirements for New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Minimum and recommended system requirements for running New ‘n’ Tasty on Windows, Mac and Linux are available on the Steam store page.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is New ‘n’ Tasty as difficult as the original Abe’s Oddysee?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty comes with three difficulty modes. Easy and Medium difficulties introduce a health system similar to the one from Munch’s Oddysee: Abe has a number of birds that represent his health, and when he takes damage, birds will fly out from him. He can replenish his health by rescuing Mudokons or spotting health birds out in the wild, but some dangers will still be one-hit kills, like bombs and meat grinders.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">This means that many more people can now experience the full story of New ‘n’ Tasty like we think they should, but we haven’t forgotten the challenge-seekers amongst you! The Hard difficulty level will have one-hit kills throughout, and you’ll need to complete New ‘n’ Tasty in Hard to get all the PlayStation trophies. Hard mode still comes with QuikSave, but you’re under no obligation to use it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For an even harder challenge, the Alf’s Escape DLC is an expansive bonus chapter designed to stretch your advanced control skills to their limit. And players looking for an ongoing challenge can compete for the fastest times on New ‘n’ Tasty’s online leaderboards.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How long is New ‘n’ Tasty?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty is the same complete game as Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee, so the answer will be different depending on how familiar you are with the original, as well as the difficulty level you’re playing on and how determined you are to find all the secrets. We estimate a new player will be playing for 8 to 12 hours if they’re trying to rescue every Mudokon.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">However, we fully expect that speedrunners will annihilate that time, and we’ve included online leaderboards so you can compete for the fastest playthroughs with your friends and other Oddworld fans worldwide. There’s even a trophy for beating our developers’ best times.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does New ‘n’ Tasty have a platinum trophy?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, New ‘n’ Tasty has a platinum trophy on PlayStation platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty have a single trophy list across all PlayStation platforms, or separate trophy lists for each PlayStation platform?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty has a single trophy list shared by all three PlayStation platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">We were getting a lot of conflicting opinions on whether we should do that or let players earn three sets of trophies (including platinum trophies), so we ran a poll on Oddworld.com. The results were 2:1 in favor of that single, shared list, so that’s what we’re going with.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will New ‘n’ Tasty have 3DTV support?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> New ‘n’ Tasty does not have any 3DTV support.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I be able to change my controller layout to the Abe’s Oddysee layout?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Currently you can’t change the controller layout for New ‘n’ Tasty. We focused on creating a single control scheme that is best suited to the expectations of modern players. For example, you can now use the analog sticks to control Abe’s movement and throwing with much more precision than in Abe’s Oddysee.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">However, we have added to all platforms two ‘old school’ modifiers that bring the controls more in line with what long-term fans will be familiar with. ‘Button to run’ and ‘sideways hop’ can be independently toggled in the Controls menu from the main menu or in-game pause menu.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In addition, we are looking to add the ability to custom-bind controller layouts in the next patch for Steam (1.02).</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are the music/speech/sounds in New ‘n’ Tasty the same as in Abe’s Oddysee?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> All of the audio in New ‘n’ Tasty, including voices, sound effects and music, has been rerecorded at the high quality expected of modern games. The soundtrack has been recreated accurately, so you will not miss the classic music you remember from Abe’s Oddysee. Abe’s voice is still provided by Lorne Lanning.</p>
<p><strong>ODDBOXX</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is Oddboxx?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> The Oddworld Oddbox is a compilation of the first four Oddworld games, available on PC and now PlayStation 3. It contains Abe's Oddysee, Abe's Exoddus, Munch's Oddysee and Stranger's Wrath, with HD versions replacing the originals as appropriate. It's available only as a digital download bundle. Read all about it here.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I still buy the Oddbox if Munch’s Oddysee HD isn’t currently available in my country?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will any of the games play on PlayStation 4?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> No, the Oddboxx is not currently available for PlayStation 4.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Which languages will I get for Abe’s Oddysee, Abe’s Exoddus and Stranger’s Wrath HD?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> You should get the appropriate language for your territory.</p>
<p><strong>Q: My Oddboxx game still isn’t working on PC, can you help me?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Make sure you meet the minimum system requirements for running the game in question, and ensure you read the support text that has been posted on the Steam forums. If you’re still experiencing technical problems, email tech support with a good description of your troubles and details of your computer specs.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER GAMES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there ever be new Oddworld games?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Yes! Looking into the future we hope to return to other unreleased projects (SligStorm and The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot), including the long-awaited continuation of the Oddworld Quintology with Squeek’s Oddysee. It is far too early to start talking about these or any other future plans.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell me about Abe HD?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Abe HD is now Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty - you can read about it here.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell me about Hand of Odd?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Hand of Odd was originally conceived and announced in the 1990s as a relatively typical RTS game, and a hugely detailed 4-inch-thick design document already exists. We will be reworking the existing designs to suit the emergent social gaming environment. When we talk about taking inspiration from Zynga, we are talking about the ‘freemium’ business model, NOT their games. Hand of Odd will NOT be like FarmVille or CityVille. What we are saying is that it will be free to play, but there will be monetized elements. Beyond that, we can’t comment on gameplay, platforms or other details because they’re not set in stone. Hand of Odd will hopefully deliver in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>COMMENTS AND ALF</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Why hasn’t my comment been approved on Oddworld.com?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> All new users require to have their account manually approved for commenting - we aim to review all new users within 24 hours. Alternatively, your question might be in line to appear in the next Dear Alf, or it might be a frequently asked question that Alf’s tired of answering.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who is Alf?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Alf is our liaison with the fans. He was introduced in Abe’s Exoddus as Abe’s friend who followed him through the desert. Alf went on to open Alf’s Rehab &amp; Tea, where Mudokons sick from SoulStorm Brew come seeking rehabilitation, and where Oddworld fans come seeking answers to their questions.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you be releasing your games on Mac/Xbox 360/[insert platform here]?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> We are a platform agnostic developer, no longer building games for any specific system, and we’ll always looks to bring out projects on multiple platforms. We have to be realistic and consider how easy it would be to do that, how well the game would play on that system, and how many sales we’d see from it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Unfortunately, Stranger’s Wrath HD exceeds the 2GB limit on XBLA titles, and we’re unable to publish via Games on Demand because we haven’t published two disc products (Stranger and Munch were originally published by other companies). We have not given up and are in ongoing communication with Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do Mudokons have four fingers on each hand in Abe’s Oddysee but only three in Abe’s Exoddus?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A:</strong> Well, it’s a long story that needs to be told. So here it is… Japan has a strict discriminating policy against any simulated characters entering their country with four fingers. Historically, Japan has had a subclass of meat packing workers that were typically looked down upon in their society. In later days, the blatant displaying of a four fingered hand gesture, intentionally directed at another, came to mean that you were calling them a member of the meat packing sub class. Which, we understand, was not at all a compliment.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">It appears that the four finger connection with the meat packing class was due to work related accidents, but was so frequent that it came to symbolically represent the sub class. It seems as though this is a part of the Japanese history that some groups within Japan would like to see forgotten. Therefore, it is at great risk that you publish four fingered characters in Japan, as you may very likely end up in legal battles with a vociferous pressure group. This group claims that this type of representation is equivalent to and as degrading as the yellow star forced to be worn on Jews by the Nazis during the Second World War. That is, it’s offensive and degrading unless they can extort enough money out of you. Then it’s all okay. Case in point: We were told that the Walt Disney Corporation is charged five million dollars a year by this group so that Mickey Mouse may live in Japan and retain his original four fingered design. Otherwise, old Mickey would need to see a surgeon and have something done about that insulting forth finger.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The moral of this story is… if you want to pay, then it’s okay. If you don’t want to pay, then it’s a horrible insult to our culture. In other parts of the world we have a word for these types of two-faced tactics. We call it extortion. If it is truly offensive and degrading, then don’t allow it at all. But to allow it for a price… is to belittle the case altogether. It suggests that the real truth behind these groups is that they are using the darker moments in their own cultures’ history as an excuse to coerce money out of content providers.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Well, being that this is Oddworld, we felt that this seemed like a perfect addition to the Abe story. We thought it was ironically perfect that he was being discriminated against for being who he was. As the message came from Japan, “They don’t like his kind here,” with the sincere suggestion, “Just chop off one of his fingers cause you don’t have the money to pay up…” caused us to feel that we indeed needed to allow Abe to go through the suffering that goes along with being a poor slob at the bottom of the Food chain. Yup, we chopped off his finger so that the Japanese wouldn’t get offended (or paid). He didn’t like it one bit, but due to the fact that their ain’t much he can do about it… we decided that he could donate his finger rather than us donating five million dollars. Such is life in Japan when you’re a four-fingered meat packing worker.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">And that is how Abe lost his finger in Japan. He’s still pretty pissed off about it, but we convinced him that with the amount of games sold in Japan, he still might be able to get his message through to their culture someday. As a true believer in his cause, he felt that the sacrifice of a finger was but a small price to pay in hoping to shed some light on discriminations and injustices the world over.</p>
