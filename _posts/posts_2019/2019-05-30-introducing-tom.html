<p><strong>Role</strong><br />
Character artist / Cutscene lead</p>
<p><strong>Q: How long have you worked with OWI?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Tom Bramall:</strong> I first worked with Oddworld as a staff member on the production of New ‘n’ Tasty, initially making the characters and working on the cutscenes later into development. After NNT was complete I began to pursue a Freelance career, but continued working with Oddworld on Soulstorm.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell us briefly what your job entails?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Tom Bramall:</strong> My principal role is as a Character artist and I primarily work on creating the cinematic versions of our characters. I am also the lead of the Cinematics team, responsible for working with the other disciplines to pull together the characters and their animations into Unity. I build the sets, set up the shots with lighting + FX and generate the final renders. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7L29DMzKco&amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Shaman</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nHf_ejvqA0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Train sequence</a> that were shown at Unite 2019 are some of my recent work.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What made you want to get into games dev?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Tom Bramall:</strong> I was addicted to games as a kid and I’ve always had a huge passion for art, so the two naturally went hand-in-hand. I cut my teeth making mods for some of my favourite games at the time - Carmageddon 2, Half Life 2 and Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. I had so much fun doing those mods that I decided I wanted to get into games as a career.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Favourite game of all time?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Tom Bramall:</strong> Of all time? Bloodborne.<br />
Right at this moment? Escape from Tarkov.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why are you excited about Soulstorm?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Tom Bramall:</strong> For me, definitely the visuals. I’m a big fan of Oddworld from all the way back in the PSX demo disc days so it’s a real honour (and super cool) to be bringing these characters and scenes to life for current gen graphics… again!</p>
