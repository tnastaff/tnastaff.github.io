<p><strong>Instantly intrigued</strong></p>
<p>For me it's a toss-up between Blizzard's <em>StarCraft</em> and Microsoft's <em>Age of Empires</em>. In the end I put more hours into <strong><em>StarCraft</em></strong>, probably because of the awesome sound and gameplay, and overall attention to detail. Blizzard really gets the interface and entertainment value right - their games are simple to use and endless fun.</p>
<p>I'm most looking forward to playing (or pointing and clicking around) LucasArts' <em><strong>Grim Fandango</strong></em>. I spent about 15 minutes with the demo and was intrigued by the characters, the story, the quality of the art and voices, and the unusual nature of the whole experience. I instantly pre-ordered a copy at my local store.</p>
