<p><strong>FEAST YOUR EYES ON A FANTASTIC NEW PLAYSTATION 2 ADVENTURE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>FACTS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>GAME: ODDWORLD: MUNCH'S ODDYSEE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>FORMAT: PC PLAYSTATION 2</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>OUT: AUTUMN 2000</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>MULTIPLAYER: NO</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>TYPE: STRATEGY / ADVENTURE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>BY: ODDWORLD INHABITANTS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>STATUS: 30% COMPLETE</strong></p>
<p><strong>COMPANIES TEND to make weekly claims that their forthcoming project is the most ambitious game ever developed, but the first screenshots of <em>Munch's Oddysee</em> on PlayStation 2 suggest that the company behind it may be justified with their boast.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>WHAT IS IT?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Munch's Oddysee</em> is the third game from Oddworld Inhabitants, the makers of the successful <em>Abe's Oddysee</em> and <em>Abe's Exoddus</em>. Whereas the previous titles were 2D puzzle-based adventures, the new game will offer you the whole of Oddworld to play with, in a unique blending of nearly every game style under the sun. The game will be a hybrid of action, strategy, adventure, roleplaying and simulation games - all rolled into one great gaming experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>GRUMPY ODD MEN</strong></span></p>
<p>Fans of the older games will be pleased to hear that Abe is back in the new adventure, but the star is Munch, last survivor of the Gabbit species. The game starts with Abe kidnapping Munch, rescuing him from a medical research facility. Munch hates Abe for the first half of the game, so expect much bickering until they learn how to get along.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>HEAD OVER HEELS</strong></span></p>
<p>Co-operation is key, with Munch able to control mechanical devices and Abe possessing living creatures. Abe is far quicker than Munch, who can be clumsy and slow. A big chunk of the game will be spent dealing with a larger number of the Oddworld population rather than the two stars: this is where the game starts to become ambitious.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>THE ODDWORLD</strong></span></p>
<p>Besides planning the survival of the lead characters, you'll also play a part in the survival of the rest of Oddworld's inhabitants. A real-time strategy-styled game allows you a hand in creatures' entire life-cycles. Rather than using a mouse to control these characters, the game will rely on Gamespeak, but in a more evolved state than previous Abe's games.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>HAND OF ODD</strong></span></p>
<p>If you're frustrated that such a promising strategy-styled game will be limited to single-player, then you'll be pleased about Oddworld Inhabitants' next project, due several months after <em>Munch's Oddysee</em>. Called <em>Hand Of Odd</em>, it'll feature the same Eco-system but will include more creatures and features to allow for a multiplayer experience. It should be one of the first games to benefit from PlayStation 2's future online capabilities. We can't wait.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>WE RECKON</strong></p>
<p><strong>So much of <em>Munch's Oddysee</em> is still shrouded in secrecy, but already it's looking fantastic. Who would have thought the Abe's games would progress to something like this?</strong></p>
