<p><strong>MISSING IN ACTION</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE BIGGEST GAMES THAT SKIPPED E3</strong></p>
<p>At every E3, there's the occasional no-show, a game that <em>everyone</em> thought would be there and instead stayed under the radar. This year's biggest blank space was the sequel to <em>Ico</em>, a rumored Sony flagship as far back as last year. SCE has trademarked the game's rumored title, <em>Nico</em>, in Japan, though, so unless the company is making a game about the rock group the Velvet Underground, we'll learn more sometime in the coming year.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><em>Psychonauts</em> and <em>Steef's Oddysee</em>, the two projects that kicked off Microsoft's release slate earlier this spring, also missed the show. Double Fine Studios and Oddworld Inhabitants are both reportedly still looking for new publishers to back them.</p>
