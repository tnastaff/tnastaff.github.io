<p><strong>ODDWORLD: STRANGER</strong></p>
<p><strong>Publisher: EA                 In Stores: March 2005</strong></p>
<p><strong>Also on PS2</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Oddworld</em> series takes a new direction with <em>Oddworld: Stranger</em>. Abe and Munch are nowhere to be found, but the story still takes place in the darkly humorous universe of Oddworld. The Stranger is a bounty hunter with lion-like features who tracks down outlaws for his payday. This is a much more action-oriented game than the previous, puzzle-based <em>Oddworld</em> chapters. The gameplay switches between a third-person perspective (for platform-style action) and a first-person view (when the Stranger equips a weapon). Keeping with the peculiar Oddworld theme of the food-chain hierarchy, the bullets that the Stranger uses are actually <em>live animals</em> which can be shot at enemies for different effects!</p>
