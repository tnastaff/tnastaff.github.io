<strong>Q: Which Oddworld creature do you think you most closely resemble?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> See now, I guess I'm probably closer to the Glukkons. You know, maybe [censored] here. You know, they're well-dressed, kinda, no tie, but at least I got a collared shirt. Abe doesn't even have... barely a loin cloth.</p>

<strong>Q: What inspired you to add different game mechanics into Soulstorm?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> Well, we had to evolve Abe, and we wanted to stay true to who Abe was. But it had to evolve, right? We have a lot more computing power, we have a lot more capability. We're in the generation of near photo realism. And we just can't keep on doing the same Abe, but we wanted to stay true to who Abe was. Then we looked at what's the most interesting way that works for Abe; and that led to scavenging, it led to the crafting. And I know some people have a negative impression of crafting: I do with a lot of games, but I think ours is very meaningful. We keep it... well, I don't want to say too much about it, but I think it works in the context. And I think hopefully the users will agree, but in doing that it allowed us to give Abe an economy, give Abe the inventory system and allow us to play in much different ways and solve the problems and puzzles with varying widely different solutions. And as we went on with the franchise, we were always trying to do that. It's just hard, you know, to have like "you can solve this puzzle in these different ways", and so the nature of our evolution of puzzles had to increase. The dynamics of how many characters were on screen, the methods of which the player had to manage those characters and those events on screen. And we wanted it to be a lot more exciting and dynamic and faster moving. So, I think that's what inspired it, the feeling that he needs to evolve, but also the platformer, we had an opportunity to evolve. So we wanted to evolve the platformer genre and Abe together.</p>
