<p>The boss of RuptureFarms and President in absentia of SoulStorm Brewery. Completely obsessed with achieving status and success whatever the cost, Molluck is the prodigal Glukkon son. If you think cruelty, ruthlessness, paranoia, and double-dealing are endearing traits, then Molluck is the C.E.O. for you. Missing in action since the destruction of RuptureFarms, Molluck is the subject of an exhaustive search by his masters, who hope they’ll find Molluck alive if only so they can have him shot.</p>

<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Molluck did everything right. He was ruthless in keeping his operations profitable and was creative in solving problematic circumstances. One such creative solution, that of sacrificing the Mudokon labor pool of RuptureFarms 1029 to save the poor quarter's bottom line, was what ultimately brought about his own down fall. It was his final creative solution, one that would ultimately have made him a hero, which indirectly triggered the consciousness of the "soon to be" Mudokon savior, Abe. Upon witnessing Mollucks proposed solution, Abe fell from ignorance and then systematically brought about the downfall of a great Glukkon.</p>
<p>Molluck was completely obsessed with success, the Glukkon way. He was single minded and highly intelligent. He was head of his class and loyal to the family in every way. Even after the fall of RuptureFarms 1029 and following disaster at SoulStorm Brewery 401, he still believed he could recover. He knew the Glukkon standard was ruthless, and that the Glukkon Queen would certainly serve punishment upon him, but he still believed that he could ultimately repair the damage. He was devoted and a true believer in the pursuit of wealth. No matter how bad things had become, he would pull it out. Even though disaster had struck and his small empire had crumbled, his belief system would not budge. No oddly disaster or mishap could bend the determination of such an obsessed and driven individual. Thus, only death would open Molluck's eyes.</p>

<h3>Production Design</h3>
<p>Nothing worthwhile happens without pain. In the case of Production Design, it is the pain of revision. Hundreds -- sometimes thousands -- of iterations are required before a finished design can emerge. Molluck the Glukkon is the first Oddworld villain to be created for Abe's Oddysee.</p>

<h3>Computer Graphics</h3>
<p>Nothing on Oddworld would exist -- from the most complex Inhabitant down to a simple blade of grass -- if not for the wizardry of the Computer Graphics department. It's their job to model every nut, bolt, and screwball on Oddworld ... then bring them to life with skillful animation and a loving eye for consistency and detail.</p>
