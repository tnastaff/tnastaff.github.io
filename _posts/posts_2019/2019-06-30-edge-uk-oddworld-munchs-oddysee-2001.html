<p>Another massively popular E3 game, <em>Munch's Oddysee</em> continues its journey towards potential triple-A status. You can now use Abe's telepathic competence to transform Mudokons into warrior types which come to your rescue should you come across an unfriendly and violent obstacle. In fact, one of the funnier E3 game-related moments occurred while Oddworld Inhabitants' Lorne Lanning demo'd the game. Lanning had convinced 15-odd Mudokons to follow Abe around the lush environments, got them to wait on one side of the bridge while he crossed, and allowed Abe to get his face pummelled by a sizeable enemy before luring the latter back towards his posse, which wasted little time in kicking the hell out of the bully.</p>
<p>It's this character richness that sets the game apart, and combined with surprisingly fluid controls (despite the 3D setting), and a convincing 'intelligent' camera system, the end result isn't unlike playing a fully interactive CGI cartoon. Which, you imagine, was Lanning's intention from the start.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The plot remains unchanged: you must still make co-operative use of the two central protagonists' individual abilities to save Abe's mother from doom</strong></p>
