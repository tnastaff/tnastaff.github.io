<pre>Title: 00276 / Bird Trap

Date of release: 31/12/2018

Official Description: A creature that eats birds. It had wings like a hummingbird, which allowed it to silently fly and capture unsuspecting prey. One idea was that he would clip Munch's feet, which was the reason he had to hop and waddle everywhere.

Artist: Farzad Varahramyan

Year: 1997

<pre>Title: 00278 / The Many Faces of Munch

Date of release: 02/01/2019

Official Description: When we were contemplating making Munch two creatures in one, it seems only natural that it would work well if both the creatures fused together were very different. Here's a sketch of what they might have looked like. One is calm and looks conent, the other frustrated and annoyed.

<pre>Title: 00279 / Arguments

Date of release: 03/01/2019

Official Description: When Munch was two creatures in one, either one could hide when they felt like it by pushing their neck down into their body. If they were arguing, one would sit down, meaning the other got a face full of floor!
