Date of release: 27/12/2018

Official Description: Back when our ideas for Munch were a little different to the finished character. Here he was originally two creatures who had been carefully selected for their skills. They were cut up and joined together, meaning that they were excellent at a number of things, especially climbing and carrying.

<pre>Title: 00275 / Rabbit

Date of release: 28/12/2018
