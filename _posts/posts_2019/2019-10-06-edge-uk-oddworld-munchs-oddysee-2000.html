<p><strong>Oddworld Inhabitants returns with a 128bit-powered second sequel to one of the most popular franchises to have graced the PlayStation to date</strong></p>
<p>Another inspiring PS2 forthcoming release currently set for launch, this time from platforming adventure supremo Oddworld Inhabitants. The action has entered the 3D realm, but rather than demonstrate all of the usual problems associated with such a move the developer has taken a fresh approach by offering a dynamic camera system that ensures optimal viewing and framing positions at all times. Further promising touches include a control system that combats what the developer terms the "virtual idiot phenomenon" â€” irritating aspects such as characters getting stuck in walls and having to demonstrate pinpoint accuracy when activating switches. In <em>Munch's Oddysee</em>, your character automatically deflects from any wall you might crush your polygonal nose on and switches have a generous trigger area in order to promote smooth navigation. Throw in innovative power-ups and weapons, RTS elements, an engrossing narrative, 60fps and pick-up-and-play controls, and <em>Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee</em> looks like becoming an enticing proposition.</p>

<p><strong><em>Munch's Oddysee</em> makes particularly good use of lighting. For the developer, gameplay is king: for instance, everything in the world is non-lethal until you can actually see it - by turning a corner, for example. This is just one of many touches</strong></p>
