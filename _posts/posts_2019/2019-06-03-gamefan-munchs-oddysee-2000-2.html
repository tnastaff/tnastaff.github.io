<p>One of our favorite developers, Oddworld, has been hard at work on their newest (and greatest) opus. After a potentially disastrous blow was dealt to <em>Munch's</em> when the PS2 did not live up to the specs they promised, we are pleased to say that all is well in the House that Abe built. Lorne and company have made remarkable steps in fixing all of the game's problems, so now, once again, <em>Munch's Oddysee</em> looks like one of the best PS2 titles.</p>
