<p><strong>Rumor Mole</strong></p>
<p>The Mole is at it again and he's got a bag full of rumors to share with you. Where's he been snooping around lately? Read on...</p>
<p><strong>A MUCH WIDER ODDWORLD</strong></p>
<p>A little Mudokon told us that the future of the <em>Oddworld</em> franchise may not reside with Microsoft, and maybe not even exclusively with the Xbox. The word around Scrabania is that developer Oddworld Inhabitants is shopping Abe's next adventure around to different publishers, and that the next title in the series may go multiplatform. As long as there's still plenty of chanting and farting on our favorite platform, then we'll be okay with that.</p>
