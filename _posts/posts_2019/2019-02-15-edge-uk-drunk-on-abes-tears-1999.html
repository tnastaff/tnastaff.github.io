<p><strong>UK:</strong> Following his recent starry step up into the world of Hollywood (see <strong>E</strong>65), Abe continues his exodus out of Oddworld with the introduction of SoulStorm Brew into the real world. Of course, whether he would approve of Oddworld Inhabitants' licensing of the infamous addictive liquid of SoulStorm Brewery is a moot point â€” it's the reason that the Mudokon people are enslaved to mine the graves of their ancestors in the first place.</p>
<p>And after actually tasting the dark foamy liquid ('part bones, part tears, bottle-conditioned real ale') <strong>Edge</strong> is confused as to why anyone would be the least bit interested in the concoction. Assuming it's the only thing they get to drink, it would explain why the Glukkons are so angry...</p>
