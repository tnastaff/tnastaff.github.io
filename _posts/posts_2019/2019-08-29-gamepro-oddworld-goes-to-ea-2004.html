<p>Electronic Arts has announced that it signed an agreement with Oddworld Inhabitants for the worldwide publishing rights to the next Oddworld game for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Players will once take on the role of the Stranger, a Western-style bounty hunter who chases outlaws in the new frontier of the Oddworld universe. The game is slated for release in 2005. "Partnering with EA is a major win for us," said Lorne Lanning, president of Oddworld Inhabitants. "Through EA's first-rate publishing and marketing expertise, the expanded universe of Oddworld can reach millions of game fans and extend the reach of this distinctive series."</p>
