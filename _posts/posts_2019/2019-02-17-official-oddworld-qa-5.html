<p><strong>Concerning <em>New 'n' Tasty</em>:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> NnT was the 1st title in the series, so now Soulstorm is #2... and it made enough money to get us started on a much more ambitious Soulstorm.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> I've watched lots of people do playthroughs and learn a lot about the mistakes we made.</p>
<p><strong>Concerning <em>Soulstorm</em>'s development:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning: </strong>This game is costing at least 3X what NnT did.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> We work with contractors around the world. Only a few of us in the bay area SF. Others in... San Diego, Vancouver, LA, England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, NYC, Quebec.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> We've spent a lot of time on new core engine technology to get rid of a lot of legacy and add new dimensions to the play and way you travel through the world. This we hope helps us deliver the next titles faster as we continue to evolve new dimension into the platforming genre.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> We've been aiming for absolutely industrial epic scale.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> I'm really insecure about releasing anything sub par. It... must... be... good.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> I've got Soulstorm on the brain 24/7 missed friends weddings, vacations, presentation opportunities, shows, etc. we're really trying to achieve AAA on a much smaller budget and team than it usually takes.</p>
<p><strong>Concerning <em>Soulstorm</em>'s gameplay:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> This game will feel more like a movie than the others... with much more depth in gameplay.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> Chanting has more powers now, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Concerning <em>Soulstorm</em>'s characters &amp; wildlife:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> Toby has a role and he's really smart... but has some deep issues.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> There's a new wildlife in Soulstorm and it's going to make paramites look like puppies.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> Fleeches are my fav. Last time you saw them they were in a larvae state. this time they have hatched into something way more creepy. I guess we're committed to fleeches now.</p>
<p><strong>Concerning <em>Soulstorm</em>'s marketing &amp; tentative release:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> We need a partner to get voices in other languages. Desired but still TBD.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning: </strong>Marketing is always a challenge without huge partners... so we need to keep nurturing social reach, spreading word of mouth, and getting some partnerships for physical discs... is something we're hoping to be able to offer. Still TBD.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> I can't say release date yet but we're burning hard.</p>
<p><strong>Concerning the future of Oddworld:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> After <em>Soulstorm</em>... if you guys like it we'll be moving onto #3 in the Quintology. our completely all-new #2 (Soulstorm) is setting up to head for all 5 getting done. But we need success in sales of Soulstorm to keep going, so we need to make sure you're all pretty surprised by what we've done... so we can keep on going!</p>
<p class="quoted" style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning: </strong>We've only seen the third world of Oddworld so far in all of the games. The NEXT game (#3) will start to enter the 2nd world (economically speaking) and then the last games get into the 1st world. It's a lot like Earth so once we get into the heavily populated areas, things will start looking a lot different. Echoes of Blade Runner.</p>
<p class="quoted" style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning: </strong>Yes, Nolybab is in #5.</p>
<p><strong>Concerning other Oddworld games:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning: </strong>Can't tell more about Squeek... he's top secret.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning: </strong>We thought about a joke VR thingee. It was going to be called "the waiting game" and it was VR in a waiting room (like motor vehicles) that is full of out of work mudokons complaining about how rarely they get employed to make the next games. We actually had it running it was really creepy, but VR didn't take off so fast so we just stayed focused on Soulstorm... which was the right decision, <span style="background-color:#f6d5d9;">I</span> think you'll all agree.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning: </strong>Fangus and Stranger would get along well but with tension-filled relationship. They've both got trust issue.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Lorne Lanning:</strong> We did finally find the original source code to the original games. At least 95% of it all. That shit was hidden DEEP in the archives and hard to find after it was all archived via robot drive that only used bar code for labelling.</p>
