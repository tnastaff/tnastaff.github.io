<p><strong>Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee</strong></p>
<p><strong>Publisher T.B.D</strong>  <strong> Fall 2000</strong>    <strong>1 Player</strong></p>
<p>With the start of the new millennium, it's only appropriate that we open this month's <em>Select Games</em> with our first PlayStation2 preview! The creators of the <em>Oddworld</em> series, Oddworld Inhabitants, have prided themsleves in presenting beautiful and detailed graphics in the 2-D format in their last two games <em>Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee</em> and <em>Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus</em>. Now the <em>Oddworld</em> universe comes alive in full 3-D in <em>Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee</em> for the Playstation2. Thanks to the incredibly powerful graphics processor of the PlayStation2, <em>Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee</em> can graduate to a new 3-D world while maintaining the same level of character detail as seen in the past <em>Oddworld</em> adventures.</p>
<p>The <em>Oddworld</em> series was conceived as a quintology, a five-part saga starting with <em>Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee</em>. What most people don't realize is that <em>Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus</em> is merely an extension of the first game. <em>Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee</em> is the true second chapter of the quintology.</p>
<p>Yup, we have a long way to go! Once again, we find ourselves in the dark and industrial realm of Oddworld where social hierarchy is determined by your position in the food chain. In the game, you control Abe the Mudokon and Munch the Gabbit. Through most of the game, Munch is in a wheelchair as Abe pushes him around. Many of the same elements seen in the past two games will be incorporated, like an enhanced version of Gamespeak. However, players will also be able to torture foes by manipulating their diets to alter their body chemistry. You can turn them into sugar junkies, nicotine fiends or even helpless drunks! Your destiny is in your hands as you cause industrial accidents, adopt babies or sell them to research facilities and even build your own empire!</p>
<p>The Oddworld Inhabitants team isn't just stopping there; in the works is an <em>Oddworld</em> feature film and a multiplayer game called <em>Oddworld: The Hand of Odd</em>, both expected to be completed within the next two years. <em>Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee</em> should to be a launch title when the PlayStation2 arrives in the U.S. in the Fall. "Hello! Goodbye! Work!"</p>
