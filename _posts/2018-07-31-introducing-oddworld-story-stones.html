<p>Today we have the privilege of unveiling the next stage of Magog on the March! For almost a year, we've been working hard to compile everything Oddworld in one convenient location. From dozen upon dozens of interviews, magazine articles, forum posts, and ancient, forgotten references excavated from the WayBack Machine. Our archives are growing every day. While we still have a long way to go, the Magog on the March is pushing forward, as strong as ever. And with the range of Oddworld content at our disposal, we now have the liberty to do something with it that's worthwhile.</p>
<p>"Oddworld: Story Stones" is an effort to create compendious and completely sourced video dossiers of Oddworld's varied inhabitants, culture and locales. They will be derived entirely from facts and collect everything that is currently known about each topic. Our debut instalment takes a comprehensive look at the frightening, yet enigmatic Guardian Angel character who made a brief appearance in the unaired commercial for Abe's Oddysee. Although the Shrink was played primarily for scares—as well as a tidal swell of raw oddness—as with all the inhabitants of Oddworld, there exists an extensive history that we've excavated from various interviews, websites and literary sources.</p>
<p>Prepare to be blown away by the amazing depths of THE ODD.</p>
