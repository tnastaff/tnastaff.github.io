<pre>Title: 0001 / Character concept sketches

Date of release: 04/12/2017

Official description: Our characters go through a whole bunch of changes, ideas and sketches before we end up with the final, recognizable creation. These very early concepts from Farzad back in 1996 show some of the more esoteric ideas we were throwing around at the time, but can you guess who this character would eventually become?

Artist: Farzad Varahramyan

Year: 1996

<li>According to Bernice Wakefield (<em>Official Oddworld Discord</em>) of Oddworld Inhabitants: "They became Fuzzles. Well they were concepts for what creatures were going to be 'lab rats'. Not a fuzzle. Early designs for lab rat creatures. Fuzzles were used instead. Our equivalent of lab bunnies."</li>

<pre>Title: 0002 / Munch concept sketch

Date of release: 05/12/2017

Official description: An early exploration for Munch, from 1998. "The starting direction for Munch's character was that he's got one leg and hops like a bird; two arms that are pretty weak and an RS232 port embedded in his skull. The port he got from the Vykkers Research Lab allows him to jack into technologies." <em>Lorne Lanning</em>.

<pre>Title: 0003 / Mudokon queen concept

Date of release: 06/12/2017

Official description: An early exploration for Sam, a Mudokon queen who is also Abe's mom. She's too large to move and is imprisoned here with one of her children. Her eggs are born into the workforce with the 'Shrink' AI Sam's only companion, designed to keep her motivated and positive to lay more productive eggs. Sam was intended to feature in both Munch's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus, and she is a character we will return to someday - her story will thicken.

<pre>Title: 0005 / Munch

Date of release: 08/12/2017

Official description: A very early study for what would become Munch in Munch's Oddysee. Maybe this one's a little bit too grim...?

<ul>
<li>According to Bernice Wakefield (<em>Official Oddworld Discord</em>) of Oddworld Inhabitants: "I like imagining how different the game would be if Munch looked like that. What you'd have to do to make players empathise with a character that looked like that. But I think generally speaking people wouldn't find him as easy to relate to."</li>
