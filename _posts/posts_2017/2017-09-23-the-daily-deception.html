<p>The Daily Deception is a propaganda newspaper featured heavily in <em>Munch's Oddysee</em>, detailing the disastrous and often humorous escapades of Abe and Munch's adventures and their effects upon the Magog Cartel.</p>
<p>The newspaper was resurrected by Oddworld Inhabitants for several short issues to keep fans invested in the franchise between the prolonged wait between <em>Munch's Oddysee</em> and <em>Stranger's Wrath</em>. Each issue is brimming with wry wit, taking fans on a short sojourn back to Oddworld.</p>
