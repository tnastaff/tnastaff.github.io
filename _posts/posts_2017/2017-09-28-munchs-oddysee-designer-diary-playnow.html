<p>While Paul O'Connor was producing his extensive designer diaries with videogames.com, he also submitted four different diary entries to PlayNOW!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, much of the content of these diaries has been lost and as such the entries are incomplete. It is unknown if there were more than four entries, as Paul O'Connor suggests he will return after the final archived entry, yet if they existed at one point they were not preserved.</p>
<p>Entry #1<br />
Here is the first installment of the <span class="title">Oddworld: Munch’s Oddysee</span> developer diary courtesy of senior game designer Paul O’Connor.</p>
<p>Entry #2<br />
PlayNOW! presents the second instalment in the <span class="title">Oddworld: Munch’s Oddysee</span> developer diary, courtesy of senior game designer Paul O’Connor.</p>
<p>Entry #3<br />
It’s time for the third instalment of the <span class="title">Oddworld: Munch’s Oddysee</span> developer diary, courtesy of that Oddworld Inhabitant, Paul O’Connor.</p>
<p>Entry #4<br />
Time to again catch up with the Oddworld team, as we gratefully devour the musing of PlayNOW! Developer diary contributor, Oddworld game designer Paul O’Connor.</p>
