<p>They say the only dumb question is the one that doesn't get asked. Well, I beg to differ. The dumb question is the one that gets asked OVER AND OVER AGAIN! So, before you write, check our list of <a href="http://oddworldlibrary.net/archives/web/oddworld.com/firsttenyears/alf/ow_ask.shtml">Most Frequently Asked Questions!</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q: When can I expect to see the PC version of Munch’s Oddysee in the stores?</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> We are currently concentrating on the Xbox version. It is yet to be determined if there will be a PC version.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will we be able to revisit some of the places Abe has been in Munch’s Oddysee? Are all those screens of the forest area Paramonia? Plus, can we go see the ruins of some of the factories Abe blew up?? </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> A return to the ruins of Rupture Farms figures in Munch’s Oddysee.</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q: I heard that in Munch’s Oddysee that Abe and Munch can travel together or seperately. What happens to Munch if Abe has to go on a solo mission? Does he just sit there, or start acting on his own?? </strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> Munch is a very young creature, only recently reintroduced to the world after long confinement inside Vykkers Labs. Leave him alone and he has a tendency to hunker down and wait for someone to come get him.</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q: Whatever happened to SligStorm? I’d heard it was going to star an albino Slig larva, and run on the Abe’s Exoddus engine. I know it’s been scrapped, but why? Can you tell s’more details about it?</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> SligStorm was briefly considered as a Playstation game, but publishing plans are always in flux, and we elected not to pursue that particular project. The SligStorm concept remains on our drawing boards and may see the light of day … and sooner than you expect.</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q: Will there be a temple for Scrabs or Paramites or something like that? </strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> Not in Munch’s Oddysee, no. But there will be plenty of new native structures that you’ve never seen before.</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q: Is the sound team planning on putting some more-appeasing-to-the-teens kind of songs, or are you guys going to stick to the classic majestic feeling of Abe’s Oddysee and Exoddus? </strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> Oddworld’s musical style is a signature element of the series, and I don’t anticipate it will change any time soon.</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q:Why is Abe blue? </strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> He’s depressed.</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q: In Abe’s Exoddus, who is the guy that is locked all alone in the brewery that gives Abe the power to heal the three he frees from the tear extractor?</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> There are helper Mudokons scattered all through the Abe adventures. They’re friends of BigFace.</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q: The Oddworld Universe has amazing images. Who does the art, who draws and paints these masterpieces? Also, I’ve noticed that in many pictures a Mudokon is holding a spear. Was this an early addition to the game, or just an artist’s conception?</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> Oddworld has a staff of very talented Production Designers responsible for creating the Oddworld Universe the old fashion way (pencils, paints &amp; paper)! The Mudokon-with-spear was early conceptual art, and never appeared in a game.</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q: I read that the planet of Oddworld is ten times as big as Earth and that all the action has taken place in the region of Mudos. Will other regions be revealed in Munch’s Oddysee?</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> The action of Munch’s Oddysee remains in Mudos … but you haven’t yet seen even a fraction of Mudos, let alone other areas of the world that will appear in future Quintology titles.</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q: I was wondering on Oddworld if there are casinos, clubs, and amusement parks? I also want to know what type of religion does each species have? Also, you are sooo cute Alf!!!!</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> The Glukkons love casinos, clubs, and amusement parks, and we have tentative plans to feature such venues in Munch’s Exoddus. As far as religion goes … well, Glukkons worship Moolah, while Mudokons keep their religious feelings to themselves.</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Q: In Abe’s Exoddus(PC), the credits have a movie-like picture with mudokons all wired up to these “devices” by their feet. Is this a movie that I missed, or is it a cut-scene from Munch’s Oddysee? </strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> Not sure, but it sure sounds like you missed the Bad Ending where Abe gets his butt fried!</p>
