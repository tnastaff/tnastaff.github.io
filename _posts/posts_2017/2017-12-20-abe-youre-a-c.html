<h3>Oddmeme History</h3>
<p>The "Abe, You're a C***" meme was created in 2016 by the Oddworld Forums user <strong>Nepsotic</strong> in response to a proposed role-play<a href="http://www.oddworldforums.net/showthread.php?t=22288" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> thread</a> from <strong>AbeMudokonPop8</strong> where forums members would ask Abe a question. The rather absurd rules dictated by AbeMudokonPop8, however, and the general lack of imagination or ingenuity quickly resulted in forum members turning the thread into a joke, spinning ridiculous questions and throwing gratuitous insults at the character of Abe.</p>

<p>The joke quickly exploded, fuelled by Oddworld Forums Discord users <strong>Paul</strong> and <strong>Phoetux</strong>, who began generating and spamming popular memes adjusted to include variations of "Abe, You're a Cunt". It is now aÂ phrase that has entered the Oddworld Forums lexicon and is often used in jest toward other members.</p>
