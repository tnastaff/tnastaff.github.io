<p>Dear Rehabbers,</p>
<p>I've decided to take a bit of a sabbatical. A break, a vacation, leave, furlough. You've been truly gracious, putting up with my saucy witticisms, and I've accepted your slanderous back-talk with tears of admiration (Bet you're wondering if Muds really have tear ducts, eh?) Together we've gleefully decimated the pleasantries and formalities of the common FAQ. Now it's time to lock up the rehab, power down the computer, mute the ringer, and take off to travel this big ball of dust called Oddworld in search of the most exotic teas, the most outlandish tabloids, and all things odd.<br />
Until then... Stay Odd!</p>

<p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><i>Alf</i></span></span><br />
Proprietor, Alf's Rehab and Tea</p>
