<p>One-time drunk and current evangelist, Alf has been a lifesaver for Mudokon dipsomaniacs. Armed with a twelve-step program, old-fashioned revivalism, and his miraculous Tea, Alf’s cure is the drug of choice for strung out Mudokons on a bender. "My name is Alf … I had my first Brew when I was with Abe, in the desert …" Sing it, brother!</p>
