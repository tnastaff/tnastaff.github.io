<p>This month, we asked the creators of our favorite animated games to imagine what ten films they would want with them on a desert island. Coincidentally, three films were selected by more than one person: Mad Monster Party by Rankin/Bass, Akira by Katsuhiro Otamo, and Fritz the Cat by Ralph Bakshi. Theresa Duncan is the creator of animated CD-ROM games for kids, including Zero Zero , Smarty Pants and Chop Suey. Lorne Lanning is the creator of Oddworld Quintology , a new series of animated 3-D role playing games.Doug TenNapel is founder of The Neverhood and creator of Skullmonkeys, a game for Sony PlayStation, coming in 1998.</p>
<p><strong>Lorne Lanning’s Picks:</strong><br />
<em>“To truthfully answer these questions I must first consider our most basic human needs. The good news is that many of these needs can be substituted with a theatrical experience. I know this to be true because they taught me about it in art school. So, (drum roll please) here are the ten animated movies that I would want with me if I were Gilligan.”</em></p>
<p>1. <em>Xmas in South Park</em> by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. To give me hope... and get through my darkest moments.</p>
<p>2. <em>Fantasia</em> (Disney). I know everyone loves this film, and I know that it is one of the greatest animated movies of all time. But I would bring it along to help me get some sleep.</p>
<p>3. <em>Dumbo</em> (Disney). For when I thought about how lonely I was, at least there would be someone I could make fun of.</p>
<p>4. <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> by Mamoru Oshii. So that when I got really mad thinking about why my family left me on this island... I could watch someone else being hurt.</p>
<p>5. <em>They’re Back!</em> (Amblimation) I’ve always loved the animation, but the story has been proven to have adverse affects on dysfunctional people. So this film would be for when I desperately needed a laxative.</p>
<p>6. <em>The Secret of Nimh</em> by Don Bluth. I always had a soft spot for rats as they continually gave me comfort through the low points in my childhood. (Please don’t laugh. It’s true.)</p>
<p>7. <em>Ninja Scroll</em> by Yoshiaki Kawajiri. Because I would need at least one exercise video and my supernatural shadow crawl still needs a little work.</p>
<p>8. <em>All Dogs go to Heave</em>n (MGM). Because sometimes I would feel like biting someone too.</p>
<p>9. <em>Fritz the Cat</em> by Ralph Bakshi. To remind me that things could have been worse.</p>
<p>10. <em>Akira</em> by Katsuhiro Otomo. Because I would finally have the time to figure out the story.</p>
