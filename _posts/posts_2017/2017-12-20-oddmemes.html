<p>The eclectic and long-enduring Oddworld community has survived primary on the archaic vBulletin board known as <a href="http://www.oddworldforums.net/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oddworld Forums</a>, a website with a turbulent history that has played host to a horde of fascinating members. Each of these members have displayed bizarre and borderline questionable traits, and despite the decreasing relevance of the forum itself, have remained a poignant—if exclusive—voice that has evolved to embody the revered strangeness of the source material. A community worthy of a thesis or investigation, this is the last place you want your children coming to spend their free time. As such, an extensive library of memes has been born out of this odd crucible of miasmic affairs, which we will attempt to preserve here.</p>
