<p>The design process of <em>Stranger's Wrath</em> was not chronicled as heavily in diary entries like its predecessors <em>Abe's Exoddus</em> and <em>Munch's Oddysee</em>. The author of the previous diaries, Paul O'Connor, was no longer working at Oddworld Inhabitants at the time, and as such, only two entries were produced. Both were penned by different authors, covering two distinct areas of production.</p>
