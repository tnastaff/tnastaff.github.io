<p>It’s official folks. Gravity Crash creators Just Add Water have confirmed that they’re officially working on more than one new Oddworld game.</p>
<p>“It’s with a huge amount of pride that we can announce that for the past 12 months we have been working extremely closely with the fantastic people at Oddworld Inhabitants, from what started off as brief discussions in June 2009, to now working on multiple projects, across multiple platforms” read the press release.</p>
<p>Whilst we cannot go into specifics right now, we can tell you that over the coming weeks and months we will be announcing these exciting projects starring all of your favourite Oddworld characters.</p>
<p>“To work with the team at Oddworld has been amazing; being able to tap the minds of Lorne Lanning, Sherry McKenna and others has been fantastic,” said Just Add Water’s Managing Director Stewart Gilray.</p>
<p>“It’s almost symbiotic in that when something moves forward on any of the projects we just start chatting about new items, or what if we do this,” Gilray continued. “We’re all extremely excited to breathe life into the Oddworld universe and indeed to let it breathe life into us.”</p>
<p>This is fantastic news. Congrats to Just Add Water and everyone over at Oddworld Inhabitants. We’ve missed you Abe.</p>
