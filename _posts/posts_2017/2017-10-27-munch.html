<p>How would you feel if you broke your only leg in a trap, were abducted by soulless scientists, had an alien device implanted in your skull, and found out your race had been hunted to oblivion? That's right, you’d be mad as hell ... and so is Munch, a one-legged amphibian with a song in his heart and a plug in his head. He’s the last of his kind and you need to help him bring his species back from the brink of extinction.</p>

<h3>Biography</h3>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6521 alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_main.jpg" alt="img_main.jpg" width="234" height="252" /></p>
<p>Latamire Munch is all that remains of the Gabbit race. Munch was born in the wild,where he swam with his family, a "pod" of Gabbits who were all hunted to extinction for their eggs. Gabbit eggs are sold over the counter as "Gabbiar".</p>
<p>Munch is awkwardly mobile on land and far more agile in water. He usually looks innocent enough with extremely expressive eyes, but when pissed off, Munch growls and bears his teeth to reveal a frightening, even demonic-looking expression. The port in his head allows him to "possess" technology and free test animals from their cages. He can also use the sonar features of his skull port to hone in on those trapped critters if they happened to be hidden in obscure places.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-6532 alignleft" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_main2.jpg" alt="img_main2" width="234" height="227" />After being lured into a Vykkers trap, Munch's main interest is to free himself of the horrors happening within the hull of Vykkers Labs and find his family. Being a highly social creature, Munch finds it necessary to seek out compatible friendships. Munch lives with the sneaking suspicion that he might, in fact, be the last of his kind. Since real-world evidence has suggested that he just may be his species final living member. Consciously realizing the full impact of this possibility is far beyond the capabilities of such a young, socially needy creature. Thus, Munch has lived in denial. To avoid thinking about such disturbing subject matter, Munch tries to stay close to the comfort of others. Being around others makes him feel more safe and content. Company helps him to keep his mind from drifting into dark and disturbing territory. Unfortunately for Munch, the suppression of his fears manifests itself as a severe phobia. Munch has a terrible fear of being left alone.</p>
<p>Before being tricked, trapped, and captured by the Vykkers, Munch wandered the waters of Mudos in search of others of his kind. After his Vykkers Labs escape, Munch has been forced to return to Vykkers Labs in efforts to help Abe rescue the Mudokon Slaves and also recover the last can of Gabbiar.</p>

But when Munch escaped from Vykkers Labs he used his skull port to seek out and rescue, instead of retrieve, those critters caught in traps wherever he might come upon them. He could also use the sonar features of his skull port to hone in on those trapped critters if they happened to be hidden in obscure places.</td>

<td>Munch is awkwardly mobile on land but quick and agile in the water. He can awkwardly carry some things in his mouth, but in general he's far from being a powerful workhorse. He usually looks innocent enough with extremely expressive eyes, but when pissed off, Munch growls and bears his teeth to reveal a frightening, even demonic looking expression. An expression so terrifying it is capable of inducing heart attack if witnessed by an unsuspecting bystander. His jaws are extremely powerful, as are his teeth, and in the endÉ his bite is far worse than his bark. The port in his head allows him to "possess" technology and also seek out trapped critters via the skull ports honing capabilities.</td>

<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td>Munch doesn't talk much. Most of his expressions, desires, and fears are communicated through his subtle body language and innocent eyes. He is afraid of being left alone. His fear of loneliness should not be mistaken for cowardliness. If his friends are attacked, he is vicious in his defense of them.</td>

<h3>Production Design</h3>
<p>Designing a new character entails endless iterations and exploration between the Production Designer and Creator. In the final rounds of designing Munch, several elements kept reappearing. The word "munch" implies a big mouth, gaping and full of teeth. Big eyes for classic reasons to make it legible on the game screen, even at a distance. Two arms and one leg, making it one limb less to worry about, but also to have a more fluid form and locomotion when in the water. Munch's single, webbed flipper leaves a "M" shaped foot print on the ground. The final design element was giving Munch's head classic shark like features. This element would play with your expectations when you first see his head skimming the surface of the water. Lastly, Munch and Abe look like they were from the same universe, and they also felt like misfits, dysfunctional buddies that you would only see on Oddworld.</p>

<h3>Computer Graphics</h3>
<p>Nothing on Oddworld would exist -- from the most complex Inhabitant down to a simple blade of grass -- if not for the wizardry of the Computer Graphics department. It's their job to model every nut, bolt, and screwball on Oddworld ... then bring them to life with skillful animation and a loving eye for consistency and detail. Munch is the first character that swims, walks and rides a wheelchair. His endearing, trusting and slightly offbeat personality comes to life in the fmv.</p>

<h3>Gamespeak</h3>
<p>Munch's GameSpeak can be found only on the Xbox. Munch greets Fuzzles "Hiya Cuties!". His relationship with his dysfunctional buddy, Abe comes to life through GameSpeak.</p>
