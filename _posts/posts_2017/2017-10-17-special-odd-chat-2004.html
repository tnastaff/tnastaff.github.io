<p><strong>Q: Really though, any specific reason that Oddworld Inhabitants as a presence wasn't at E3?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> E3 isn't the only place to announce, probably the most popular, but it can be done in other ways.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So, you guys are planning to announce somewhere else?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> It's up to the publisher when/where.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So, you guys have a publisher?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> No news on that yet, sorry!</p>
<p><strong>Q: and of rumors about more than just an xbox release?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> Rumors, rumors, rumors!!!!Arrrrrrg! I will file that in my rumor folder. What mag? OXM?</p>
<p><strong>Q: So Abe Babe, you're at OWI HQ?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Abe Babe:</strong> Yes... Well, I just saw the opening movie and gameplay demo.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How has it changed since what we saw in X-Factor?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Abe Babe:</strong> It's awesome!!! :D es...I think it was a lot more different. The graphics are absolutely amazing... the gameplay graphics are almost like the CG... there was hardly any difference. The levels appeared to be very huge. You can get lost... there seems to be lots of exploration!!! Yay!!!</p>
<p><strong>Q: How's the Live-Ammo?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Abe babe:</strong> The live ammo factor was really unique... I like that idea. ;)</p>
<p><strong>Q: do you like the game?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Abe Babe:</strong> I loved it. ;) Awesome!!! There were funny parts too. Oddworld kept their humor there too. I really think that this game will appeal more to the general gamer...although it still keeps the same Oddworld thing about it..it just seems to me that lots of people will like.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So is it pretty much a FPS?<br />
</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf's Assistant:</strong> No, the term FPS doesn't appear in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How is the music and sound, Abe Babe?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Abe Babe:</strong> I loved the music...it really seemed to fit with the areas that it was played in, as I'm a fan of game music...I really liked it.</p>
<p><strong>Q: how big was the environement/place you saw/played in?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Abe Babe:</strong> Huge!!! They seemed to go for miles.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How has OWI HQ changed since your last visit?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Abe Babe:</strong> It hasn't really...just some new posters and statues around! ;)</p>
<p><strong>Q: Did OW4 meet your expectations, or exceed them?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Abe Babe:</strong> I'd probably say exceed so far!!!</p>
