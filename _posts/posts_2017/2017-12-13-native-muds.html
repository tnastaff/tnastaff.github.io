<p>Not all Mudokons are enslaved by the Industrialists, but those that live in the wild are a vanishing breed. They don't take kindly to city-folk. These Natives fight to for the right to roam free on Oddworld. They help you when needed. In Munch's Oddysee you can transform Native Mudokon into powerful Tomahawkers and Mudarchers. Native Mudokon are proud craftsmen. They once looked very much alike, but once freed, the ancient traditions of body art, tattooing, and symbolic dress gradually seep back into their way of life and sense of fashion.</p>
