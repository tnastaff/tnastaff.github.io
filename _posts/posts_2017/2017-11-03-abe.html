<p>He's a victim, he's a dreamer, he's a klutz, and he's the first great hero in the Oddworld Quintology. Former slave laborer and RuptureFarms Employee of the Year, Abe didn't ask to be the savior of his people...and if his people had a choice, they'd throw him back.</p>

<h3>Biography</h3>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-7033 alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_main.jpg" alt="img_main.jpg" width="234" height="227" /></p>
<p>The thought of this knobby-kneed goofball leading a popular uprising against the MagogCartel caused panic and not a little shrieking, but against all odds, Abe has sucked it up and followed the hero’s path with only occasional diversions into hysteria, terror, and near-suicidal bouts of depression. Since earning some pretty special mystical tattoos, Abe is capable of possessing his enemies, turning invisible, healing the sick, and can even become the all-powerful Shrykull when circumstances allow.</p>

<p>While small in stature, and somewhat feeble in brain, being the chosen one does have its perks. Abe can turn invisible, and has the ability to possess and control any creature he comes across…from the measly Slig to the mighty Scrab. He’s also got a mighty, mighty fart which he can control and make explode.</p>
<p>Abe thought his troubles were over after shutting down the RuptureFarms meat packing plant. Just as he was accepting the praise and adulation from his Mudokon brethren, three Mudokon spirits appear and tell him he’s got another quest. Glukkons are now using Mudokon bones to make brew!</p>
<p>When not committing terrorist acts against Glukkon business establishments, Abe can usually be seen rescuing Mudokons or running from various forms of Oddworld wildlife. Abe has been known to vacation in Necrum, the Mudokon City of the Dead.</p>

<td>Abe has an incredible sense of intuition. His sense of obligation is so strong that any commitments he has made (even if he made them in the hallucinatory or dream world) must be followed through. Some would think that Abe has difficulty making any distinction between the realms of reality and fantasy. The truth is that Abe makes no distinction between the two. To him, they are one and the same.</td>

<td><strong>Secondary Interest</strong></td>

<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td>Ideally, Abe would love to just kick back and rest for awhile. Directly opposed to his desire for relaxation, is his sense of duty when it comes to the plight of his people. He feels indebted to the cause of rescuing the exploited Mudokon from all franchises across the land.</td>

<td>Abe is skinny, his skin is blue, and he wears a loincloth. His lips have been sewn shut since birth and he sports some fantastic tattoos. These tattoos seem to have a life of their own because they grow and expand on him over time. He has acquired most of his tattoos from various mystical trials that he has been challenged by. Spirit guides had empowered him with additional tattoos to aid him in achieving their interests.</td>

<h3>Production Design</h3>
<p>Nothing worthwhile happens without pain. In the case of Production Design, it is the pain of revision. Hundreds -- sometimes thousands -- of iterations are required before a finished design can emerge. Our titular hero Abe began life as a rebellious monk forced by the stitches in his lips to maintain a vow of silence. Through the process of revision, Abe evolved into the happy, sappy meat factory messiah we know and love today.</p>

<h3>CG</h3>
<p>Nothing on Oddworld would exist -- from the most complex Inhabitant down to a simple blade of grass -- if not for the wizardry of the Computer Graphics department. It's their job to model every nut, bolt, and screwball on Oddworld ... then bring them to life with skillful animation and a loving eye for consistency and detail.</p>

<h3>GameSpeak</h3>
<p>On Oddworld, words have tremendous power. With GameSpeak Oddworld’s heroes can persuade, cajole, insult, tease, threaten and even whisper sweet nothings to other Inhabitants. GameSpeak is an original Oddworld feature challenging the player to communicate with other characters in the hero’s own voice. Oddworld’s Inhabitants express real-world attitudes and emotions with which humans instinctively identify.</p>
