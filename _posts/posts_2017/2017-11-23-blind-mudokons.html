<p>"Let me ask you this. If it's dark all the time, do they need—I mean really need—to see? They're just slaves in a mine. They work by feel. If they can't see, then they won't notice they're mining the bones of their own ancestors in Necrum. Besides, I've got a line on a profitable after-market for Mudokon eyeballs."</p>
