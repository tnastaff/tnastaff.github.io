<p>During the height of the <em>Soulstorm</em> Alternate Reality Game, Alf made a surprise return to penning his love letters for the fan community. Unfortunately, his snarky correspondence only served as promotional material for the ARG, and as soon as he peaked his head, our witty and whimsical mudokonÂ vanished yet again.</p>
<p>It is currently unknown if Dear Alf will return.</p>
