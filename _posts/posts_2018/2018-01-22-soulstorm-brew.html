SoulStorm Brew Employee Happenings and Information.<br />
The SoulStorm Brewery is about more than simply the production of the best beverage ever created on Oddworld; we're also all about the people that work here! (sort of). If you're interested in a behind the scenes look at the Brewery and the folks that toil here, then take a look inside...you just might be surprised. Excerpt(s) from SoulStorm Brewery Employee Handbook</p>

An excerpt from the autobiography of SoulStorm Brewery's VP Aslik.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://magogonthemarch.com/employee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Slav - er, Employee of the, uh, Moment!"</a></strong><br />
At random times throughout the year, the management at SoulStorm Brewery likes to make a half-hearted attempt at helping their employees feel like more than grease in the cogs of a big corporate machine over which they have no control and under which they suffer daily. Sure, it's a farce, but it usually boosts productivity by AT LEAST 2 or 3 % in the days following a new announcement. So here's our Employee of the Moment!</p>
