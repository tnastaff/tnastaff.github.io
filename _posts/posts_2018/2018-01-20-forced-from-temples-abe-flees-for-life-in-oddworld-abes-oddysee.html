<p><strong>Only Eight Days Until GT Interactive Unveils 'Odd Friday,' September 19</strong></p>
<p><strong>MUDOS, ODDWORLD, September 9, 1997</strong> - In perhaps the last message from the beleaguered Abe, the former RuptureFarms slave has sent a final plea out to the species of the worlds asking them to join in the fight against the evil corporate monolith known as RuptureFarms.</p>
<p>"The game is about to begin and all I'm asking is for an adventurous few to undertake my Oddysee with me," says Abe. "Molluck has sent his gun-toting Sligs to hunt me down and keep me from rescuing my people. I have only eight days left until 'Odd Friday' and I'm asking for help. Please, follow me."</p>
<p>Species looking to help Abe may do so at participating retailers now where they may reserve a copy of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee and receive an authentic enlistment guide filled with hints and tips from Abe on how to defeat Molluck.</p>
<p>GT Interactive's new Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee for Sony PlayStation and Windows 95 will debut nationwide on "Odd Friday," September 19. An all-new game play experience for Sony PlayStation and Windows 95, Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee ushers in the new A.L.I.V.E. (Aware Life forms In Virtual Environments) genre of gaming which features GameSpeak, real-time conversation between characters. The title recently garnered "GamePen's Best of E3 Show Award" for PlayStation, awarded by a consortium of industry media.</p>
<p>Oddworld Inhabitants was co-founded by award-winning producer Sherry McKenna and high-end visual-effects supervisor Lorne Lanning. Both have extensive experience in the ground-breaking application of computer-generated images (CGI) in film, commercials and theme park rides having worked together at Hollywood-based Rhythm &amp; Hues Studios. OddWorld creates "A.L.I.V.E." games that marry life-like character motion with intuitive controller interfaces inside highly rendered backgrounds.</p>
