Interviewer: Oddworld.com

Interviewee: Drew Card</pre>
<p><em>Oddworld's Inhabitants are as diverse as the world they've worked together to create. Here's where you'll find interviews and other informative articles spotlighting the many creative folk that work at Oddworld Inhabitants. Be they headline players or behind-the-scenes heroes, the Inhabitants profiled here all share Oddworld's ceaseless dedication to bringing you the best worlds and games that you've ever experienced.</em></p>
<p><strong>Drew Card, Programmer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What's your background?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Drew Card:</strong> I grew up in Northern Virginia. I went to the University of South Carolina and majored in Mechanical Engineering. My senior year I met my beautiful wife Rachel. Eventually Rachel and I wound up in Massachusetts where she attended grad school, and I worked for ATI programming graphics demos and tools. I spend a very brief three months at Westwood Studios before Electronic Arts decided to close the studio down. After Westwood I wound up at Oddworld and I have been here for a year and half now.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Of all the job opportunities that programmers have these days, what made you choose games?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Drew Card:</strong> That's a silly question! Who wouldn't want to work on video games? I love video games and I love programming. It's like adding chocolate to peanut butter; it just makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What parts of the game do you work on? Is there anything on this project you really wanted to make happen but couldn't, or one thing that you got to do that you're especially proud of?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Drew Card:</strong> I've primarily worked on the in-game effects system. I've also written a couple of tools for the artists and designers. I'm most proud of a tool that I wrote for editing in game cinematics.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the easiest part of your job, and what is the hardest?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Drew card:</strong> Anything that involves windows interface design is pretty easy. The hardest part for me is scheduling. Sometimes things you think will be super easy wind up taking forever and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do the other programmers at Oddworld influence the work that you do? Is it a team effort, or does each person kind of do his or her own thing?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Drew card:</strong> It's a little of both. We bounce ideas off one another, and brainstorm on the best ways to tackle different problems. For the most part, we each do our own thing.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is a typical day like for you?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Drew card:</strong> I usually arrive at work around 10 a.m. ... check my email ... write some code ... debate with the office communists ... write some code ... Photoshop someone's head on funny picture ... write some code ... battle Mark Lee in Tetris Attack... write some code ... head home at about 7 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who (or what) inspires you? Why?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Drew card:</strong> My wife and my parents are great sources of inspiration for me, and I'm lucky to have them all in my life. They all give me great advice and support.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you like to do when you're not at work?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Drew card:</strong> Mostly I just hang out with my wife and dog. Lately we've been going to the beach a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What CD are you currently listening too?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Drew card:</strong> "Pennywise", "Rise Against", and "Stretch Arm Strong".</p>
<p><strong>Q: What's in your game console or pc right now?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Drew card:</strong> The greatest game ever created ... Tetris Attack!</p>
<p><strong>Q: What kind of a place is Oddworld? Do you have any wacky work stories that you could share?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Drew card:</strong> Oddworld has a great laid-back atmosphere. Wacky story: One time, fellow programmer Dave Moore tried to catch a rugby ball between his feet only to land on the ball and fall. It was hilarious to watch.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is your favorite headgear to wear during a poker tournament? Do you enjoy beating poor old ladies at Texas hold 'em?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Drew card:</strong> I used to wear these sweet Cadillac sunglasses when I played, but lately I've just been playing sans headgear. If by old ladies you mean Charles Bloom, Mark Lee and Dave Moore then yes.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Which do you prefer, U.S. Dollars, or Solid Gold Bullion?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Drew card:</strong> GOLD BULLION BABY!</p>
<p><strong>Q: If you could change jobs with one of the other Inhabitants who would it be and why?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><strong>Drew card:</strong> I would change jobs with Lorne because he has a cool office.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What advice would you give someone trying to break into games? What type of education does someone need to do your job?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Drew card:</strong> Pay attention in math class, and read every book on software design you can get your hands on.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Q: Who is your favorite Oddworld character? Why?</strong><strong><br />
<strong><br />
Drew card:</strong> </strong>Stranger. His animations are great.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell us something about the new game? Please!</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Drew card:</strong> The upgraded weapons are super cool.</p>
