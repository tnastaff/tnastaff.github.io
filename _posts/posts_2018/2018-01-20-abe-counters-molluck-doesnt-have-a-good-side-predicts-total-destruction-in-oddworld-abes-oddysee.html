<p><strong>GT Interactive Continues Countdown to 'Odd Friday,' September 19</strong></p>
<p><strong>MUDOS, ODDWORLD, August 26, 1997</strong> - Responding to RuptureFarms assertion that the company embraces a competitive retirement plan, Abe, former RuptureFarms "Employee of the Year," asserts that no one has come forward because everyone has been annihilated.</p>
<p>"Bring me one Meech, Scrab or Paramite that has retired from RuptureFarms and show me his gold watch," challenged Abe. "I can say without hesitation that being ground up into meat pops is not our idea of retirement and that it is only a matter of time before we see Hominids and Grits."</p>
<p>Abe also states that there is an entire untamed territory outside of the RuptureFarms compound where native Scrabs, Paramites and Mudokons live deep within the forests and deserts of Oddworld. These creatures are the wild incarnations of their ensnared counterparts and his dealings with them have been dicey, as they are totally unpredictable. He said there is also a creature known as an Elum that is extremely independent and is probably left alone because it smells too awful to eat.</p>
<p>Species looking to help Abe may do so now at participating retailers where they may reserve a copy of GT Interactive's Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee for PlayStation or Windows 95.</p>
<p>GT Interactive's new Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee for Sony PlayStation and Windows 95 will debut nationwide on "Odd Friday," September 19. An all-new game play experience for Sony PlayStation and Windows 95, Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee ushers in the new A.L.I.V.E. (Aware Life forms In Virtual Environments) genre of gaming which features GameSpeak, real-time conversation between characters. The title recently garnered "GamePen's Best of E3 Show Award" for PlayStation by a consortium of industry media.</p>
