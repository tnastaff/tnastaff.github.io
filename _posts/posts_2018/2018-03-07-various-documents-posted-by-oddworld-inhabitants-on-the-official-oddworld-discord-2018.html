<pre>Description provided by Alex Carroll: Flyers that were distributed at EGX in, er, 2014? Old logo... yeah, a lot of stuff goes through multiple revs. I don't normally keep the older stuff but there you go - in this case apparently i did.</pre>

<pre>Description provided by Alex Carroll of Oddworld Inhabitants: PS4 launch promos for social media. Pretty sure these were used, at least most of them, although perhaps not quite like this.</pre>

<pre>Description provided by Alex Carroll of Oddworld Inhabitants: I took a few 4K shots from NnT for the PC release. I love this one, in fact, I adore the way Paramonia looks, it's my favourite section of NnT.</pre>

<hr />
<pre>Description provided by Alex Carroll of Oddworld Inhabitants: A simple (forgive the blurring) one-sheet handed to press during a small preview event in earlyish 2014. This one's unofficial, I should add, it was just something I threw together before the game was shown.</pre>

<hr />
<pre>Description provided by Alex Carroll: Some early comps for the start logo that would appear before the very first NnT trailer. I think the ones with the saw were best. I'm pretty sure Tom did some if not all of these super quick.</pre>

<hr />
<pre>Description provided by Alex Carroll: i kinda wanted to do something like this with the can sticking out over the Vita header, but assumed it wouldn't get through</pre>

<pre>Description provided by Alex Carroll: the vykker variation was going to have this massive eye on the back</pre>

<hr />
<pre>Description provided by Alex Carroll: i liked this idea, but it clashed with the front too much</pre>

<hr />
<pre>Description provided by Alex Carroll: this one didn't get very far
but it was going to be really minimal</pre>

<pre>Q: so you designed the MO CE boxart? Are you responsible for all of OWIâ€™s graphic design then?

Alex Carroll: it's generally a mix between me and pete, yeah. but obviously everything goes past LL at some point. pete did the actual CE, btw. i handled the actual Vita covers, pete did the CE box itself, and the innards (and he also did the can, the CD cover, etc).</pre>

<hr />
<pre>Description provided by Alex Carroll: When we were porting the game to Vita one challenge was the lack of haptic feedback when getting shot. One suggestion I had was to visualise Abe's health with a little green health bar (bottom right). This was scrapped in place of more obvious camera shake.</pre>

<hr />
<pre>Description provided by Alex Carroll: Porting to Vita meant not only visual compromises (a lot of geo had to be stripped back) but also the way NPCs are handled was redone, in particular ensuring they were completely culled when off screen and in really busy areas (like the Nest levels) I had to set up trigger zones every few feet to switch on and off the enemies to ensure only a few were running at any one time. You can see this if you retrace your steps, especially in the Paramite Nests level.

Still, I adore the Vita version, it has really nice controls and kinda suits the AO aesthetic. We pushed hard for native res and tried our best to get it to 30fps as often as possible. It's the version I play the most, I think.</pre>

<hr />
<pre>Description provided by Alex Carroll: Suggestions for context-sensitive (and optional) UI button prompts that sadly didn't make it into NnT. These would have been great for first time players.</pre>

<pre>Description provided by Alex Carroll: Scrapped idea for a trailer. I think this was for E3, bizarrely, and I'm happy it got binned as the humour felt a little forced.</pre>

Description provided by Alex Carroll: here's a shot of the loading icon.
exclusive! it was partly inspired by the bonewerkz logo it spins it's cute it might end being changed before release (you get the idea). this one conveys more. there's more happening that just loading. it's also not a loading 'screen', it's a loading icon.

Description provided by Alex Carroll: the trick is to ensure you bring some meat from outside. then it's easy. and man, NnT had some daft bits. there are currently zero such drills in soulstorm. currently none [UXBs]. soulstorm doesn't really work on the same basic set of rigid puzzles. think more organic encounters. the intention is: to allow players to play the game their own way if they want. in fact, we actively reward such invention. i think there was a bug on ps4 that we fixed for pc where the drills were linked to the framerate so in some cases they were actually too fast. that said, we all beat the game so it's possible! but this kind of feedback (rather than 'wrong green') is actually super useful.

Description provided by Alex Carroll: found a version that was like 10,000 pixels wide yesterday. it's huge. Thought about that image: the version above is the original, it was flipped for the print ad. But Abe's left hand is meant to be the Scrab scar, right? yeah so in the print ads, it's the wrong hand. haha, rumbled.
