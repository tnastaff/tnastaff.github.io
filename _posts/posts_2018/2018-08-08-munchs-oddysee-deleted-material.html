Official Description: The Oddworld: Soulstorm team chat is a fountain of amazing information. #FunFact #ThingsYourBossSays

Transcript: Munch was originally a experimental lab tape worm. Abe swallowed him to help him escape. Abe would then puke him up whenever he needed a swimmer. For some reason... we decided it may not be charming enough.

<pre>Munch's Alter-Ego

Date: 06/08/2018

Official Description: Munch was originally going to have an 'alter ego' - this lovely looking fella - but sadly it didn't make the final release; he was supposed to be more of a Jekyll and Hyde character. Abe could slap him and get him mad, which provoked him and he'd turn into this maniacal killer!

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>OWI's response to question asking if this ability was specific to Munch, or something all Gabbits possess: "Specific to Munch, it was due to all the experimentation the Vykkers did on him ..."</li>
</ul>
