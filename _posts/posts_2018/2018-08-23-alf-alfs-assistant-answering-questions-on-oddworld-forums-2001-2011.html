<p><strong>Alf:</strong> You fans are terrific! I love reading your insights.<br />
Fuzzles are sweet and cute and are good natured.They can be pretty ferocious too. Fuzzles follow Munch around and help out if asked too. Attack,etc.<br />
The Vykkers use them for experiments.<br />
You are gonna love fuzzles!<br />

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox are all great systems with terrific games. It's not about one being "bad" and the other "rules".<br />
It's about choices, like t.v.'s, computers ,or cars! We live in a world of CHOICES!<br />
Oddworld chose to go with the Xbox because we are a first party game with them. MS and Xbox offers an incredible amount of technical support. It's hard for you fans to understand how difficult it is to make a game. OK I said my peace.<br />
Stay odd. Alf</p>

That's why they are our number fans because their sites are their own creation.<br />

I'd like to address a few of these comments here.<br />
We did not choose the Forums as FOM because we are lazy or too busy with the game.<br />
As a "group" you are outstanding! Loyal and patient. The topics are fun to read. We wanted to acknowledge all of YOU!<br />

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> Cool yes, but not exactly accurate Lampion.<br />
That's a Glukkon in the gamescreen. It's not Molluck but more like a Jr. Exec.<br />
Syd, notice this Glukkon's shoulders aren't as broad as Molluck.<br />
You can possess Glukkons but I can't tell ya anymore right now. Stay tuned. Alf</p>

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> The image of the elums in the forest was originally slated for Hand of Odd. That image is not from Munch's Oddysee.<br />
Paramites, Scrabs, Meeps, Fuzzles are some of the wildlife in Munch's Oddysee.<br />

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> Hiya:<br />
The pics you are referring to are production art for Munch's Oddysee. Many of these images and concepts did not make the cut. Final game does not include many of the the "Status" images.<br />
Look for these to show up in Munch's Exoddus.<br />

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> Dear Sydney,<br />
You have been a wonderful fan and we at Oddworld loved Oddworldian.net<br />
It was well written and produced with a lot of class. I will truly miss your site. You are the kind of fan a franchise can only dream of having. Oddworldian.net will go into the hall of fame of Oddworld fansites.<br />
I'm sorry you lost interest in Oddworld. It's been a hard journey for us and especially our fans. The reality of business is difficult. Oddworld is a young company and we are learning. It breaks my heart that you have lost interest. It was a pleasure Sydney. Best of luck to you. You are a fine young man. It's been a blast, keep in touch!<br />

<p>The group Music Instructor was not responsible for this new single. The producer for Get Freaky also produced "Use Yur Imagination" with E-Pac and featured artist Jean Beauvoir in Germany. (check out www.jeanbeauvoir.com )</p>
<p>We can't post the entire video because it just came out but I can tell you that it's 100% OWI cg.</p>
<p>Maybe fans can write in and request "Use Yur Imagination".</p>

<strong>Alf:</strong> This production design image is one of the first sketches done of Glukkons. The image of the Glukkon on the right is a Glukkon without it's big suit on. Remember Molluck in the good ending of A.O.<br />
Don't read too much into the small costumed Glukkon. This is just a exploratory piece that never got anywhere. Oddworld releases many of it's pre production images to our fans because they are so "art" oriented.<br />

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> Please remember that fans from around the world come to these forums. Writing and understanding English is not easy for some.<br />
I think some fans might be misunderstood due to their lack of writing and translating to English. What sounds like boasting might not be. Try to be tolerate and understanding of all Oddworld's Inhabitants.<br />

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> You are correct Abe Babe. We look out for fans who inspire US.<br />
We don't say "Hey, who should be fan of the month this month?" and search for someone to fill that spot. It's usually the opposite.<br />
for example: We recently had 3 fans we wanted to honor and we honored them one at a time. Lantra had to wait a few months!</p>
<p>Sometimes we go months without any fom's. Not because there are no deserving fans, we just need a break.</p>
<p>thanks for asking!</p>

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> A fan has never been invited by us to tour the studio. We receive requests from fans from the forums, students, fans of the game, teachers etc. Each request is reviewed and it's determined whether a tour should be granted or not. Sometimes it's just by "luck" and good timing, as we have slow periods and busy periods during production. When we are really busy, we don't allow any non inhabitants in the studio. Actually we prefer fans not to elaborate on their tours as it's a priviledge not a right. So there have been folks who have toured who have never said a word in public about it. Hope this clears up any misconceptions.<br />
Any other questions?</p>

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> My dearest One, Two...<br />
Tho protest too much!<br />
Here are the facts:<br />
One: According to A.E. it is never stated that the muds walked in One day. We see morning to dusk but there is no indication that this is the same day? When we cut to the muds running to Necrum, it could possibly be a different day but the same time of day. This is definitely debatable.<br />
Two: There is no measurement of distance or miles on the map. None.<br />
Three: Yes, Oddworld is 10 times the size of Earth.<br />
Since there is no size comparision to Earth, then we can assume that the planet is indeed big.</p>
<p>Four: If Mudos is bigger than Earth, wouldn't it take longer for the planet to complete a full rotation? And if it is farther from the sun<br />
than Earth, wouldn't the rotations be even slower still? And wouldn't that make for more daylight hours?</p>

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> One more point.<br />
Abe and the Muds did not leave from Monsaic Lines, but from Monsaic Sanctum.<br />
check out universe/native/facilities on the website.</p>
<p>There is no point of reference to where the Monsaic Sanctum is in relation to Necrum Mines.</p>
<p>but I love all the charts!!!</p>

Monsaic Sanctum is indeed in Monsaic Lines.<br />

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> Heya, just wanted to let you know that there are cards in XBM, too. You have to cut them out yourself, but still kinda nifty. Issue three. Not to endorse a publication or anything, but they also have a cool thing going where if you collect all the issues and line them up the spines form an image of our best bud Abe! Maybe the next image will form oh, say, I don't know, a picture of a proprietor, of maybe a rehab of some sort....</p>

<p><strong>Wil Bunce-Edwards: This true story doesn't seem to be well-known enough. I'll tall it again. After Abe's Oddysee came out, one fan wrote to OWI suggesting that Mudokons could have more of a personality so that players would sympathise more, which of course we got. Incredibly, this fan actually sued OWI for taking aboard his/her idea, and OWI had to stump up the cash. So, they're very cautious about how they deal with such requests. I'm sure that there will be a few 'easter egg' names, though.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> Just so ya'll know, Oddworld has never been sued by a fan, and even in the quote that Max later posted, there was no mention of Oddworld being sued.</p>

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> Dear Fans,<br />
Let me clarify. Oddworld is not listed as an exhibitor by e3 because we are part of the Microsoft and has always been part of the publishers booth. (GT, Infogrames and now Microsoft).</p>
<p>I am not confirming that we are exhibiting at e3 in the Microsoft booth. I'm just confirming the reasons why we are not listed as an exhibitor.</p>

<p><strong>Q: i am going to california this summer to get a look see at oddworld studios, they have tour guides, yipee and i may also apply for a job there, they need a visual accord and scoregivers for their next game....</strong></p>
<p><strong>pleez come to cali this summer</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> Wow Sligslinger! You have a lot of confidence and passion! These are important traits when looking for a job in the gaming industry. I just want to wish you the best of luck. If you really want a job in games, I know you can make it happen! Just keep in mind there is a lot of hard (and fun!) work involved in getting there first. An internship is a great idea, and an excellent way to get your foot in the door at a game developer. Oddworld is, well, Odd in that we've never done internships, but lots of game studios do. It is a fun and effective way of getting into the games business.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">As for tours, we do not have "guides" here at Oddworld, sorry. We have a few kind employees who have taken time out of their work schedules to make it happen from time to time, but we don't really officially give tours, especially when we are facing a busy production schedule. And on the rare occasion that a tour was granted, I swear on my finest fez that no money changed hands!!!!</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Have a great trip to Cali- We are enjoying balmy 90 degree weather here in SLO : )</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Odd Luck!!!!!</p>

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> Wow! It seems like the title has brought out the <em>wrath</em> in some of you! I do want to point out that the actual game is the same regardless of what the name is, so I hope that those of you who don't like the title (and YOU ARE entitled to that opinion!) will be just as excited about the game regardless of what it's called. Some cliche about not judging a book by its cover comes to mind.....</p>

If you are looking for these, try the Gamestar: November, OXM: Dec and keep an eye out for EGM.... and hopefully even more to come as we are getting closer to launch!!!! Soooo exciting!!!!</p>

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> 1. It is actually <em>DEAD HENS PASS</em> : )<br />
2. Ammo types = 9<br />
3. No more darts.<br />
At the risk of being hated, I just have to torture you all anyway by telling you how much fun the ammo is. I'm trying not to brag, because I am here at OW and that would be wrong, but personally, I love it! There are so many ways to "attack" this game! I hope that all the fans have just as much fun once you get it in your hot little hands!!!!</p>

If I understand the confusion correctly the ninth type are Wasps, which Oddish pointed out. No darts. Assuming you know what the other 8 are. Then there's the upgrades..... Ahhhhh uuuuupgraaaaades!</p>

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> I highly recommend doing whatever you can to get the presell DVD. For fans and collectors it is a must have. This is the first time all the movies have been compiled on a single source separate from the games. If you order online you might want to call and double check to make sure you get it, due to the limited time offer status. If you get it in-store (January) you should be able to get it <em>real time</em> : ) Contact your retailers!!!!</p>

<p><strong>Alf's Assistant:</strong> None of the live ammo is killed by Stranger.<br />
The boombats and their upgrades live in sulphur caves and eat a lot of sulphur and nitrous.<br />
If they were not used for ammo, they would eventually self destruct into one big boom. Thus, their name Boombats.</p>
<p>The upgraded Slug has the same problem. It's life span is very short and it's very happy to help out.</p>
<p>Fuzzles, bolamites, stunkz, chippunks, stingbees all go about their business after being shot from the crossbow.</p>

He had just lost his beloved wife and felt like taking his own life. On a whim, he went out and purchased a PlayStation with a few games. One being Abe's Oddysee. It brought great joy to him and regularly wrote letters to Oddworld. These letters were many pages describing his game playing adventures.</p>
<p>He was quite a character who in his old age, was an avid gamer to boot. Oddworld and Lara Croft being his favorites.</p>
<p>We kept an album of all his letters and photos for anyone to view. He wasn't a wealthy man and would save up his money to make color copies of the various Oddworld characters. He would always send us ideas for ads and cards.</p>
<p>One of my favorite memories is of Alf and the Xbox controller. He wrote mail to us at Oddworld, asking to pass on his letter to Bill Gates at Microsoft. This letter kindly stated that the Xbox controller was quite uncomfortable to use. He used to play games for hours and hours. He drew some diagrams, made suggestions on the redesign of the controller.</p>
<p>Another memory was when his brief experience with the internet. Once "connected", he found many other interests online too ; )</p>
<p>The past few years found our Alf in and out of the hospital, yet he always kept in touch. Always kind, cheerful and with impeccable manners ... Alf was our beloved fan.</p>
<p>He loved the fantasy world and stories of Odd and his STORY was truly inspirational for those of us at Oddworld Inhabitants.</p>
<p>Alfred Gamble, you will be missed.</p>

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> Paul, what can this humble Mud say? I'm sorry if you feel I've let you down. We get a lot more questions than you'd think, including a LOT of repeats! Yours must have gotten caught up in them somewhere. For the record, Munch won't be coming to PSN, it relies on too many Xbox-specific technologies.</p>
<p>Web 2.0 has really taken off since we first took a break from the radar, and we're still getting used to it. Hopefully you know that my usual gig is to release monthly Q&amp;As, but under Web 2.0 that can seem slow, even rude. I was wondering what you dedicated folks on the forums thought about this.</p>
<p>You might have noticed the cheeky "Volume 1" label on the latest Dear Alf... These might become a more regular feature than they were in the old days. Alternatively you might think they're completely outmoded and I should just answer all questions as I get them. Let me know what you'd love to see, guys!</p>

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> Now now, we're a few days from beta. No need to ruffle us up, we'll get round to the marketing thing in good time. I believe we're still on track for a summer release.</p>

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> Yes, that's the Abe you'll be seeing in Munch's Oddysee HD. He'll look even better in Abe HD!</p>

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> The Munch's Exoddus documents are ten years old. Just we <em>have</em> them. Our schedule doesn't have a slot for it right now.</p>

<p><strong>Alf:</strong> Take a chill pill, people. Just Add Water didn't even port Munch to PC, they only took over its development a couple of weeks before it released. The HD remakes require much more fundamental changes than languages, there's simply no point putting them in BEFORE the HD versions come out, or we'll have to plug it all in again. Just stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is the Paramite's head smaller?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Alf:</strong> Err, it's the same model, just higher definition. Nothing else has changed.</p>
