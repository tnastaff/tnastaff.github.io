<pre>Title: 00269 / Ears

Date of release: 20/12/2018

Official Description: A small, timid creature that evolved so its ears looked like eyes. This would scare predators away. They could hear threats easily with their ears being so large. For some unknown reasons the Vykkers cut their ears off.

<pre>Title: 00270 / Hands

Date of release: 21/12/2018

Official Description: This creature's diet would consist of foods that grew high up in the trees. As a result, it evolved so that its hands turned into mouths, making it easier for it to reach. The food would travel down the arm and go straight to the stomach. The sharp teeth were also useful for clinging onto rock faces, making it an excellent climber.
