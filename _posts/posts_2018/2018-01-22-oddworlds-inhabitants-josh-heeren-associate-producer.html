<p><strong>Q: What's your background?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Josh Heeren:</strong> I grew up in San Luis Obispo working for my Dad's landscape business, after high school I wanted to get out of the landscape industry so I got a job as a mechanic. After realizing that while I enjoyed working on cars, I didn't enjoy working on other peoples cars all day every day. I then went to Cal Poly and majored in Agricultural Engineering. During all of this I was interested in video editing and video production as well as computer graphics. Just when I was almost done at Cal Poly I changed my major to Photography and digital imagery. Right about then Oddworld entered the picture and here I am...</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who are your biggest influences? Why?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Josh Heeren:</strong> My Dad is the biggest influence as far as teaching me how to do whatever it takes to get a job done and done well.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why did you decide to go into the video game industry? Why Oddworld?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Josh Heeren:</strong> The "why Oddworld" explains the "why the game industry" I was always really blown away by Oddworld's look and just how cool the movies looked. I wanted to work at Oddworld to work on the movies more than to be in the Game industry.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you like to do when you're not at work?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Josh Heeren:</strong> I like to do almost everything. I love to hike and camp, snowboard, wakeboard, build things, and brew beer.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What CD are you currently listening too? What book are you reading?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Josh Heeren:</strong> CD I am currently listening too? Well... Beastie boys Paul's Boutique in the car, System of a down Toxicity at home, and Suicidal Tendencies Lights Camera Revolution in the garage while I am building things.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What kind of a place is Oddworld?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Josh Heeren:</strong> It's a wacky place, at least my corner of it.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What does a producer do in a game company?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Josh Heeren:</strong> What I do...scheduling, planning, making documents and lists, and organizing reviews. My duties also include video editing work and making tapes to send out to various places. Often I am a bridge between the director and the artists. I guess you could say I am a problem solver, sometimes problem maker, and a go between, depending on who you ask.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is a typical day like for you?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Josh Heeren:</strong> There are no typical days, just days that end to quickly and sometimes days that never end.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you like best about coming to work?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Josh Heeren:</strong> Just coming to work is what I like best, the worst part is going home at the end of the day.</p>
<p><strong>Q: If you could change jobs with one of the other Inhabitants who would it be and why?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Josh Heeren:</strong> Anyone in the CG department, because they are just so cool.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What at Oddworld are you most proud of?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Josh Heeren:</strong> I am most proud of the movies from Munch's Oddysee, I think everyone involved did a great job.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Many fans are upset with Oddworld's decision to develop for the Xbox exclusively. Any comments?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Josh Heeren:</strong> Get over it...</p>
<p><strong>Q: What advice would you give someone trying to break into games? What type of education does someone need to do your job?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Josh Heeren:</strong> Learn as much as possible about everything and you will be unstoppable...</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who is your favorite Oddworld character? Why?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Josh Heeren:</strong> I like the Sligs and I don't know why!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell us anything about the new game or what you are working on right now?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Josh Heeren:</strong> Well right now I am working on this interview, but I am almost done.</p>
