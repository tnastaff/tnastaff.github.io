<pre>Title: 0070 / Opinionites

Date of release: 09/03/2018

Official description: Opinionites. They served the queens but it went to their heads, now they think they are always right and constantly complain. Their ears and minds are closed. They add large, false arms and spinning hats so they're more likely to be noticed. Most pay them no attention. Their mouths grew bigger and they grew second tongues so they could talk more. Though their opinions became absurd, the queens kept them around. No-one is sure why...

Artist: Farzad Varahramyan

Year: 1998
