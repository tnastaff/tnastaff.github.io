What's so great about being in "Admin.?" We get more natural light than the production team that has to work on the dark side of the building.<br />
How does working for a game company differ from working at other companies? Contrary to what everyone else who works here would answer, I actually work more regular hours now than I did at previous jobs. My wife knows who I am now, and I think it scares her.</p>

<p><strong>Janet, Accountant </strong><br />
What exactly is your job at Oddworld? A broad description according to the Director of Human Resources Michael Reifers (many thanks to Mike for his invaluable help with my answers) for me it is "I am an accountant therefore I account for things." Oddworld Inhabitants know me best for handing out paychecks on paydays.<br />
Best part of your job? I look forward to coming in to work each day. I get to do something I love with incredible people to work for and with. I also promised that I would put this one in for Mike, "I also get to work next door to Michael Reifers, Director of Human Resources."<br />

What inspires you? Work for and with people who inspire me each day, but I would be remiss if I did not say that my greatest inspiration are my parents. They always told me no dream I ever had was too big or out of reach for me to make a reality and that the best people were the ones with the most interesting thoughts and unusual dreams.<br />
Favorite thing to do when not at work: I would love to say it's exercising, but I just can't in good conscience, as I am too sporadic at it to call it a actual hobby. I read and watch digital cable in my spare time.<br />
Favorite read: I love to read, my favorite authors are Wilbur Smith, Janet Evanovich, Sujata Massey, Donald Westlake, Dana Stabenow and JK Rowling.<br />
Any Admin. words of wisdom or OW secrets that you can share?? For every big or little triumph in life there is going to be alot of trying going on to back it up.<br />
How does working for a game company differ from working at other companies? I have worked outside of the gaming industry and when I look back, I think that the biggest difference is that I work with people who follow their dreams rather than just go in to a job each day. I am fortunate to work with a highly artistic, intelligent, intrinsically motivated group of people who inspire me each day through their hard work and passion for Oddworld.</p>
