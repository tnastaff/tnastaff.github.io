<p>You may not have thought about it, but the value of your benefits amounts to a considerable sum each year in addition to the wages or salary you earn. In addition to the wages lost to you through taxes, graft, and incompetence, these are just a few of the bogus ways your pathetic salary is misdirected by RuptureFarms each year:</p>
<p>Accidental Death/Dismemberment Assurance<br />
Annual Party or Outing to a Walled Enclosure<br />
Dental Probes<br />
Disability Leaves of Absence (Permanent)<br />
Education Assistance (Lobotomy)<br />
Education/Training (How To Perform Lobotomies)<br />
Funeral (Bereavement) Leave ... note, Funeral Leave has replaced Lunch Hour<br />
Group Term Life Insurance (with RuptureFarms as sole beneficiary)<br />
Paid Holidays (after fifteen years' service)<br />
Paid Vacations (after hell freezes over)<br />
Personal Leaves of Absence (see Disability Leaves of Absence)<br />
Short-Term Disability Assurance<br />
Sick Room<br />
Social Insecurity<br />
Stock-Option Program (someday, we promise!)<br />
Unemployment Re-education Service (see Accidental Death/Dismemberment Assurance)<br />
Worker's Compensation Insurance (Anesthetic)</p>
<p>That's a lot to think about!</p>
