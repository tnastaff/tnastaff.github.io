<p><strong>Three Days Until GT Interactive Launches Game on 'Odd Friday,' September 19</strong></p>
<p><strong>RUPTUREFARMS, ODDWORLD, September 16, 1997 </strong>- In an ominous statement issued from within the cavernous halls of his headquarters, Molluck the Glukkon, chief executive officer of RuptureFarms, has promised to destroy every living thing on Oddworld if the "scrawny little sausage-meat known as Abe" is not found and brought before him by September 19.</p>
<p>"I will grind him where I find him!," screamed Molluck. "I want that worm and anyone who has helped him, and I want them now. I promise that I will not rest until this contemptible little piece of Slog slop is brought chained and manacled before me."</p>
<p>Spitting and choking on his cigar, Molluck was led away by his phalanx of armed Slig bodyguards.</p>
<p>Molluck has previously stated that he will begin production on a new meat product on "Odd Friday," September 19. The product is rumored to be made of Mudokon body parts and is a last-ditch attempt by the CEO to bolster declining profit margins.</p>
<p>Molluck's declarations cap a month-long verbal war of words between the besieged CEO and the overwhelmed Abe, a scrawny Mudokon laborer fighting to free his people from enslavement and extinction at the RuptureFarms meat processing facility. Abe's whereabouts on Mudos are currently unknown.</p>
<p>GT Interactive's new Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee for Playstation is shipping on "Odd Friday," September 19, with the PC version scheduled to follow later this month. An all-new game play experience for Sony PlayStation and Windows 95, Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee ushers in the new A.L.I.V.E. (Aware Life forms In Virtual Environments) genre of gaming which features GameSpeak, real-time conversation between characters. The title recently garnered "GamePen's Best of E3 Show Award" for PlayStation, awarded by a consortium of industry media.</p>
<p>Oddworld Inhabitants was co-founded by award-winning producer Sherry McKenna and high-end visual-effects supervisor Lorne Lanning. Both have extensive experience in the ground-breaking application of computer-generated images (CGI) in film, commercials and theme park rides having worked together at Hollywood-based Rhythm &amp; Hues Studios. Oddworld creates "A.L.I.V.E." games that marry life-like character motion with intuitive controller interfaces inside highly rendered backgrounds.</p>
