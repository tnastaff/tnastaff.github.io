<p>"Down from the rough but noble hill tribes of Canada these 5 young TDs roll down, their souls hewn from the living rock of such towns as 'Whoopdie', 'Mudness' and 'Shtum'. Trying to outrun their past in the secret experiments unwittingly pushed on them from an unforgiving government, they have injected an exuberance into the CG department that you would, in any other circumstances, have to kill someone to get."<br />
