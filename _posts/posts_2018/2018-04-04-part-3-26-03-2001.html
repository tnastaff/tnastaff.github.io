<p><strong>CG Dept. Part Three</strong></p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-9070 alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_main.jpg" alt="img_main" width="234" height="227" />Thus come the Canadian twosome, John and Shawnalee (and baby Hunter make-eth three!), this couple works in tandem, occasionally joining hands to form Giant Robot Monster. The kid, keeping in character, eats stuff.</p>
<p>Aside from having their own sitcom that is broadcast on a wavelength that only a bunch of geese can understand, they bring a spark and energy into Oddworld that can only be described as "Wango." All Hail Canada!<br />
-<em>Senior CG Animator, Scott Easley</em></p>
