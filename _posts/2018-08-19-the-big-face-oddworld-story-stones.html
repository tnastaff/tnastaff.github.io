<p>For the second instalment of <em>Oddworld: Story Stones</em>, we've opted to do something a little bit less lore-intensive than our debut episode. While there are almost countless subjects we can tackle, we want to show a little love for some of the more familiar inhabitants of Oddworld too.</p>
<p>The Big Face is an enigmatic character who plays a pivotal role in<em> Abe's Oddysee</em> as the spiritual advisor to the Mudokon Messiah. While little is revealed about the Big Face within the games themselves, there's some interesting tidbits and nuggets of lore that have cropped up over there years, and we've compiled them all here for your viewing pleasure.</p>
